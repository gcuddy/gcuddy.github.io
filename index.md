Hey, I'm Gus.  I'm an [actor](/resume) in theatre, film and TV.

I'm also a writer and director.

I was born in Davis, CA, grew up in Rochester, NY, and currently live in **Brooklyn, NY**. I'm of Armenian, Lebanese, Egyptian and Irish descent. But identity is complicated.

The best ways to contact me are via [email](mailto:gus.cuddy@gmail.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/guscuddy). [Instagram](http://instagram.com/guscuddy) works too. Also find me on [Actor's Access](http://resumes.actorsaccess.com/guscuddy) and [Backstage](http://backstage.com/u/guscuddy). See my [Resume](/resume) for acting inquiries.
