"But death is universal. Even gods
cannot protect the people that they love,
when fate and cruel death catch up with them." (142)

"Grief wrapped around her, eating at her heart.
The house was full of chairs but she could not
bear to sit upright. In her bedroom doorway,
collapsing on the floor, she wept and cried." (175)
Cf: Mount Eerie - Real Death

"A friend can be as close as any brother." (239)

"Think fog wrapped round our ships and in the sky
the moon was dark and clothed in clouds, so we
saw nothing of the island." (244)
beautiful language

"So did his eyeball crackle on the spear." (252)
violence

A note: there is a lot of "weeping" and use of the word "weep" in The Odyssey. And a lot of "grief". And a lot of "home".

"Whenever you allow one of these spirits
to come hear near the blood, it will be able
to speak the truth to you." (284)

"Your mind is still obsessed with deeds of war.
But now you must surrender to the gods." (305)

"As when a fisherman out on a cliff
casts his long rod and line set round with oxhorn
to trick the little fishes with his bait;
when one is caught, he flings it gasping back
onto the shore—so those men gasped as Scylla
lifted them up high to her rocky cave
and at the entrance at them up—still screaming,
still reaching out to me in their death throes.
That was the most heartrending sight I saw
in all the time I suffered on the sea." (309)

"Now he slept in peace,
and he remembered nothing of his pain." (319)

"You love fiction
and tricks so deeply, you refuse to stop
even in your own land." (326)

"The worst thing humans suffer
is homelessness; we must endure this life
because of desperate hunger; we endure,
as migrants with no home." (362)

"These nights are magical,
with time enough to sleep and to enjoy
hearing a tale." (363)

"I am old
but I will crack your ribs and smash your face
to bloody pulp—then I will have a day
of peace tomorrow." (409)
VIOLENCE. a world of cruelty.

"Echetus, the king of mass destruction." (412)

"Of all the creatures
that live and breathe and creep on earth, we humans
are weakest. When the gods bestow on us
good fortune, and our legs are spry and limber,
we think that nothing can ever go wrong;
but when the gods bring misery and pain,
we have to bear our suffering with calm.
Our mood depends on what Zeus sends each day."

"When he confronts the suitors in this hall
there will be blood." (413)

"Human beings have short lives.
If we are cruel, everyone will curse us
during our life, and mock us when we die.
The names of those who act with nobleness
are brought by travelers across the world,
and many people speak about their goodness." (435)

Page 437 - memories converge and it's almost non-linear, how the poem weaves in the past and present

Page 442 - a dream - Homer as Freud?

Book 22 (Bloodshed) is basically the first action movie. 2 dudes versus a bunch of bad guys. Hyper violence.

"Odysseus
told his beloved nurse, 'Now bring me fire
and sulfur, as a cure for evil things,
and I will fumigate the house.'" (492)
