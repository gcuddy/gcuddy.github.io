  Going through my notes on Tara Brach’s *Radical Acceptance*, I hadn’t realized how repetitive it actually was. This is somewhat helpful when reading the book, but in retrospect it could be drastically cut down. Brach repeats the same message over and over for 300+ pages. The message is beautiful, though: we must fully accept life, enter into it, its sorrow and grief and joy and love. Full awareness is love. When we are always wanting, craving, feeling unworthy, we have not awakened. Awaken to our true selves—by treating ourselves with compassion and love. Opening our heart. “This too.” We all have basic goodness. We just need to open our hearts. It’s helpful to do a body scan and pause: how am I feeling? Accept this. It has a lot to do with stoicism, actually. Gandhi, Mother Teresa...Brach says that all these great social activists practiced Radical Acceptance in some form, of opening their hearts to love, even amidst pain and suffering. We need to love ourselves. That is the essence of Radical Acceptance.

Trance of unworthiness = when we experience our lives through the lens of personal insufficiency. Trapped in this trance, we are unable to perceive the truth of who we really are.

An American Vipassana teacher asked him [the Dalai Lama] to talk about the suffering of self-hatred. A look of confusion came over the Dalai Lama’s face. “What is self-hatred?” he asked. As the therapists and teachers in the room tried to explain, he looked increasingly bewildered. Was this mental state a nervous disorder? He asked them. How could they feel that way about themselves, he wondered, when “everybody has Buddha nature.”

Mother Teresa: “The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis but rather the feeling of not belonging.”

Spiritual awakening is the process of recognizing our essential goodness, our natural wisdom and compassion.

As you go through your day, pause occasionally to ask yourself, “This moment, do I accept myself just as I am?” Without judging yourself, simply become aware of how you are relating to your body, emotions, thoughts and behaviors. As the trance of unworthiness becomes conscious, it begins to lose its power over our lives.

The way out of our cage begins with accepting absolutely everything about ourselves and our lives, by embracing with wakefulness and care our moment-to-moment experience.

The two parts of genuine acceptance—seeing clearly and holding our experience with compassion—are as interdependent as the two wings of a great bird.

Compassion honors our experience; it allows us to be intimate with the life of this moment as it is. Compassion makes our acceptance wholehearted and complete.

Rumi: “Don’t turn away. Keep your gaze on the bandaged place. That’s where the light enters you.”

Gandhi in India, Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, Nelson Mandela in Africa—all underwent the suffering of imprisonment and faced the powerlessness, loneliness and discomfort of their oppression. By accepting rather than denying or reacting to their own suffering, they freed themselves to work without bitterness or self-pity for peace and justice.

The only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle.

The particular sensations, emotions or thoughts that arise when we practice mindfulness are not so important. It is our willingness to become still and pay attention to our experience, whatever it may be, that plants the seeds of Radical Acceptance.

Learning to pause is the first step in the practice of Radical Acceptance. A pause is a suspension of activity, a time of temporary disengagement when we are no longer moving toward any goal. The pause can occur in the midst of almost any activity and can last for an instant, for hours or for seasons of our life.

Rilke: “How could we forget those ancient myths that stand at the beginning of all races—the myths about dragons that at the last moment are transformed into princesses. Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are only princesses waiting for us to act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.

One tool of mindfulness that can cut through our numbing trance is inquiry.

Yes is an inner practice of acceptance in which we willingly allow our thoughts and feeling to naturally arise and pass away.

Buddha called physical sensations the first foundation of mindfulness because they are intrinsic to feelings and thoughts and are the base of the very process of consciousness.

“Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.”

When Buddha said craving causes suffering, he was referring not to our natural inclination as living begins to have wants and needs, but to our habit of clinging to experience that must, by nature, pass away.

It doesn’t matter what is happening. What matters is how we are relating to our experience.

When we hate ourselves for wanting, it is because the wanting self has taken over our entire life.

In facing intense fear, we need to be reminded that we are part of something larger than our own frightened self. In the safe haven of belonging to others we can begin to discover the sanctuary of peace that dwells within our own being.

Taking refuge in the dharma is taking refuge in the truth that everything within and around us is subject to change; the truth that if we try to hold on to or resist the stream of experience, we deepen the trance of fear. Taking refuge in the sangha reminds us that we are in good company: We belong with all those who long to awaken, with all those who seek the teachings and practices that lead to genuine peace.

Our suffering becomes a gateway to the compassion that frees our heart.

Feeling compassion for ourselves in no way releases us from responsibility for our actions. Rather, it releases us from the self-hatred that prevents us from responding to our life with clarity and balance.

Attention is the most basic form of love. By paying attention we let ourselves be touched by life, and our hearts naturally become more open and engaged.

Without a genuine willingness to let in the suffering of others, our spiritual practice remains empty.

Basic goodness is the radiance of our Buddha nature—it is our intrinsic wakefulness and love. This doesn’t mean we can do no wrong. But in sharp contrast to our cultural conditioning as heirs of Adam and Eve, the Buddhist perspective holds that there is no such thing as a sinful or evil person. When we harm ourselves or others, it is not because we are bad but because we are ignorant. To be ignorant is to ignore the truth that we are connected to all of life, and that grasping and hatred create more separation and suffering.

When I feel moved by the music of Mozart or awed by a starry night sky, I feel part of the goodness and beauty of life. When life strikes me as funny, I feel real and human and basically good.

We forget that every person, including ourselves, is new every moment.

Because we are interconnected, when we awaken love in ourselves and express it, our love changes the world around us.

Being with good friends helps us relax about our inner weather and stop regarding our painful emotions or confused behaviors as symptoms of spiritual backsliding. As we bring our vulnerability, insight and heart into conscious relationship, we realize we are all waking up together. In this environment of togetherness, deep healing becomes possible.

A legend from ancient India tells of a musk deer who, one fresh spring day, detected a mysterious and heavenly fragrance in the air. It hinted of peace, beauty and love, and like a whisper beckoned him onward. Compelled to find its source, he set out, determined to search the whole world over. He climbed forbidding and icy mountain peaks, padded through steamy jungles, trekked across endless desert sands. Wherever he went, the scent was there, faint yet always detectable. At the end of his life, exhausted from his relentless search, the deer collapsed. As he fell his horn pierced his belly, and suddenly the air was filled with the heavenly scent. As he lay dying, the musk deer realized that the fragrance had all along been emanating from within himself.

The formless ocean of awareness gives rise to the varying and endless waves of life: emotions, trees, people, stars.
