  Tynan’s Superhuman by Habit is eminently practical. This is why I love Tynan. He gets right down to the point, no bullshit. Simple, clear, and very useful.

  The key takeaway here is that Tynan views habits as currency, like money or time. Build your life around habits. Habits are compounding: they are an investment that you make. Investing in positive habits makes you superhuman, then, because they will compound. Invest in daily, small habits. Do it every day. Never miss two days in a row. You can then even chain habits together through triggers, which is something I’m trying to do. So the trigger for zazen is my yoga, the trigger for yoga is brushing my teeth, the trigger for brushing my teeth is making my bed, the trigger for making my bed is waking up. In this way you become superhuman, just by using your time incredibly efficiently.

  The practical advice for habits is great, as well. I love some of the less expected ones: write a lot, travel to unusual countries, get rid of stuff.

INVEST YOUR WILLPOWER, don’t spend it

This is a huge theme throughout the book. Investing investing investing.

Never skip a habit twice. Absolutely never. Do it terribly if you have to.

“Remember that the power of a habit isn’t actually in the individual execution, but in the consistency.”

Reward yourself with small success (fist bump and “yes”): helps build personal system

Take Pride in Process, Not Results

You can break anything you want down into habits.

“If you are not going to follow thorugh with a habit, it is better to never start it at all.” Bad habit to fail.

Discovering Motivation:

What good will happen?
What bad will happen?
What good will happen if I don’t implement the habit?
What bad things will happen if i don’t?

Daily habits are best.

Think about the trigger

Reprogram negative habits (drugs, stimulation, negative friends) with positive habits

“Building habits takes conscious focus, and to focus you must eliminate distractions”

(What follows is some highlights from the section on practical habits. I have them all listed out in one of my journals)

POSITIVITY HABIT: From now on every time yo think a negative thought, think of one positive aspect of the situation.

“Remember that everyone is just doing their best and trying to be happy, just like you.”

Eat 100% healthy at home, not while traveling

Regulate your bedtime, not wake-up time.

Travel to places radically different than those you’re used to

Easiest way to sell electronics is on Amazon

There’s a cool method for “planning when stuck” location 1505.
