desc: Fabulous book on building the future. I love the notion of 'secrets'. Probably a must-read for thinking about business and creation. I loved it.

Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.

Unless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today.

Humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles technology. Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level.

The single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

A good answer takes the following form: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.”

Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.

No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world. Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.

Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work—going from 1 to n. Vertical or intensive progress means doing new things—going from 0 to 1.

At the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.

Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology.

My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.

The smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroundings are strangely old: only computers and communications have improved dramatically since midcentury.

A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.

The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.

The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

What valuable company is nobody building?

The biggest mistake a startup can make is to understate the scale of competition. The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.

Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets. Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets.

Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.

All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

The more we compete, the less we gain.

Marx and Shakespeare provide two models for understanding almost every kind of conflict. According to Marx, people fight because they are different. The greater the differences, the greater the conflict. To Shakespeare, by contrast, all combatants look more or less alike. It’s not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. In the world of business, at least, Shakespeare proves the superior guide.

Either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.

Simply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.

An Old Economy business (like a newspaper) might hold its value if it can maintain its current cash flows for five or six years. However, any firm with close substitutes will see its profits competed away.

If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now?

Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.

Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage.

The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite.

Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it.

A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.

A company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly.

Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements.

Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is.

Jeff Bezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books.

Disruptive companies often pick fights they can’t win. Think of Napster: the name itself meant trouble.

Being the first mover doesn’t do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. It’s much better to be the last mover—that is, to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits.

“Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.

Leanness is a methodology, not a goal.

The greatest thing Jobs designed was his business. Forget “minimum viable products”—ever since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others’ successes.

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world.

We don’t live in a normal world; we live under a power law.

The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.

Once you think that you’re playing the lottery, you’ve already psychologically prepared yourself to lose.

You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.

Every one of today's most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and unsuspected.

Contrarian thinking doesn’t make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.

What valuable company is nobody building? Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started.

Why has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left? It might start with geography. There are no blank spaces left on the map anymore.

Along with the natural fact that physical frontiers have receded, four social trends have conspired to root out belief in secrets:

First is incrementalism. From an early age, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time, day by day, grade by grade.

Second is risk aversion. People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. By definition, a secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream.

Third is complacency. Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking, but they seem to believe in secrets the least. Why search for a new secret if you can comfortably collect rents on everything that has already been done?

Fourth is “flatness.” As globalization advances, people perceive the world as one homogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is “flat.” Given that assumption, anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look for secrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute something unique.

Very few people take unorthodox ideas seriously today, and the mainstream sees that as a sign of progress. We can be glad that there are fewer crazy cults now, yet that gain has come at great cost: we have given up our sense of wonder at secrets left to be discovered.

We are within reach not just of marginal goals set at the competitive edge of today’s conventional disciplines, but of ambitions so great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution hesitated to announce them directly.

There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know. So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you?

Secrets about people are relatively underappreciated. Maybe that’s because you don’t need a dozen years of higher education to ask the questions that uncover them: What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?

A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.

When you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is whom to start it with. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, and founder conflict is just as ugly as divorce.

Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together—otherwise they’re just rolling dice.

To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to distinguish between three concepts:
* Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity?
* Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?
* Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs?

A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held.

As a general rule, everyone you involve with your company should be involved full-time.

A company does better the less it pays the CEO—that’s one of the single clearest patterns I’ve noticed from investing in hundreds of startups.

A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside.

Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in purely financial terms.

General and undifferentiated pitches don’t say anything about why a recruit should join your company instead of many others. There are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You’ll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling: not why it’s important in general, but why you’re doing something important that no one else is going to get done. That’s the only thing that can make its importance unique.

We all loved science fiction: Cryptonomicon was required reading, and we preferred the capitalist Star Wars to the communist Star Trek.

The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing.

Even though sales is everywhere, most people underrate its importance.

But customers will not come just because you build it. You have to make that happen, and it’s harder than it looks.

Advertising matters because it works.

What nerds miss is that it takes hard work to make sales look easy.

It’s better to think of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—no matter how good the product.

A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too.

If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished.

Look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson.

Computers are complements for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.

To understand the scale of this variance, consider another of Google’s computer-for-human substitution projects. In 2012, one of their supercomputers made headlines when, after scanning 10 million thumbnails of YouTube videos, it learned to identify a cat with 75% accuracy. That seems impressive—until you remember that an average four-year-old can do it flawlessly. When a cheap laptop beats the smartest mathematicians at some tasks but even a supercomputer with 16,000 CPUs can’t beat a child at others, you can tell that humans and computers are not just more or less powerful than each other—they’re categorically different.

If humans and computers together could achieve dramatically better results than either could attain alone, what other valuable businesses could be built on this core principle?

We have let ourselves become enchanted by big data only because we exoticize technology.

Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn’t stop us from making definite plans today.

The seven questions that every business must answer:
1. The Engineering Question
Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2. The Timing Question
Is now the right time to start your particular business?
3. The Monopoly Question
Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. The People Question
Do you have the right team?
5. The Distribution Question
Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
6. The Durability Question
Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
7. The Secret Question
Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?

The cleantech bubble was the biggest phenomenon—and the biggest flop—in the history of “social entrepreneurship.” This philanthropic approach to business starts with the idea that corporations and nonprofits have until now been polar opposites: corporations have great power, but they’re shackled to the profit motive; nonprofits pursue the public interest, but they’re weak players in the wider economy. Social entrepreneurs aim to combine the best of both worlds and “do well by doing good.” Usually they end up doing neither.

If something is “socially good,” is it good for society, or merely seen as good by society?

Doing something different is what’s truly good for society—and it’s also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.

Normally we expect opposite traits to be mutually exclusive: a normal person can’t be both rich and poor at the same time, for instance. But it happens all the time to founders: startup CEOs can be cash poor but millionaires on paper. They may oscillate between sullen jerkiness and appealing charisma. Almost all successful entrepreneurs are simultaneously insiders and outsiders. And when they do succeed, they attract both fame and infamy.

The most famous people in the world are founders, too: instead of a company, every celebrity founds and cultivates a personal brand.

Perhaps every modern king is just a scapegoat who has managed to delay his own execution.

Jobs’s return to Apple 12 years later shows how the most important task in business—the creation of new value—cannot be reduced to a formula and applied by professionals.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom describes four possible patterns for the future of humanity.

1. The ancients saw all of history as a neverending alternation between prosperity and ruin.

2. Conventional wisdom seems to assume instead that the whole world will converge toward a plateau of development similar to the life of the richest countries today. In this scenario, the future will look a lot like the present.

3. Given the interconnected geography of the contemporary world and the unprecedented destructive power of modern weaponry, it’s hard not to ask whether a large-scale social disaster could be contained were it to occur. This is what fuels our fears of the third possible scenario: a collapse so devastating that we won’t survive it.

4. The last of the four possibilities is the hardest one to imagine: accelerating takeoff toward a much better future. The end result of such a breakthrough could take a number of forms, but any one of them would be so different from the present as to defy description.

Recurrent collapse seems unlikely: the knowledge underlying civilization is so widespread today that complete annihilation would be more probable than a long period of darkness followed by recovery.

The future won’t happen on its own. What the Singularity would look like matters less than the stark choice we face today between the two most likely scenarios: nothing or something. It’s up to us. We cannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to work to create it today.

Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
