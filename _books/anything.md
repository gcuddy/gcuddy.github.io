desc: Excellent book on business. Sivers writes clear directives, and sums up 10 years of business in an hour. The main point here is that business is creative, and is where you get to create your own personal utopia. However, this utopia needs to always be serving the customers. Make them smile, make it useful, make it clear. Keep it simple. Be flexible, plans change. The audiobook version is excellent.

Don’t be on your deathbed someday, having squandered your one chance at life, full of regret because you pursued little distractions instead of big dreams. You need to know your personal philosophy of what makes you happy and what’s worth doing.

When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you control all the laws. This is your utopia. When you make it a dream come true for yourself, it’ll be a dream come true for someone else, too.

A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work—hopefully no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple.

If you think your life’s purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you’ll overlook the day-to-day things that fascinate you. If you think revolution needs to feel like war, you’ll overlook the importance of simply serving people better.

Success come from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.

When you present one to the world and it’s not a hit, don’t keep pushing it as is. Instead, get back to improving and inventing.

Don’t waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors.

If you’re not saying, “Hell yeah!” about something, say no.

Anytime you think you know what your new business will be doing, remember this quote from serial entrepreneur Steve Blank: “No business plan survives first contact with customers.

By not having any money to waste, you never waste money.

Necessity is a great teacher.

Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers. Make every decision—even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone—according to what’s best for your customers.

It’s counterintuitive, but the way to grow your business is to focus entirely on your existing customers. Just thrill them, and they’ll tell everyone.
Watch out when anyone (including you) says he wants to do something big, but can’t until he raises money. It usually means the person is more in love with the idea of being big-big-big than with actually doing something useful.

Ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.

To make a business, you need to multiply the two components. The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20. The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $200,000,000.

Formalities play on fear. Bravely refuse.

When you build your business on serving thousands of customers, not dozens, you don’t have to worry about one customer leaving or making special demands. If most of your customers love what you do, but one doesn’t, you can just say good-bye and wish him the best, with no hard feelings.

You need to confidently exclude people, and proudly say what you’re not. By doing so, you will win the hearts of the people you want.

It’s a big world. You can loudly leave out 99 percent of it.

When you’ve asked your customers what would improve your service, has anyone said, “please fill your website with more advertising”? Nope. So don’t do it.

You can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it. Your first idea is just one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.

So please don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.

How do you grade yourself? It’s important to know in advance, to make sure you’re staying focused on what’s honestly important to you, instead of doing what others think you should.

It’s kind of like the grand tales in which the hero needs to be prepared to die to save the day. Your company should be willing to die for your customers. That’s the Tao of business: Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you’ll do well.

Set up your business like you don’t need the money, and it’ll likely come your way.

Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.

You should feel pain when you’re unclear. Email blasts are the best training for being clear.

When you’re thinking of how to make your business bigger, it’s tempting to try to think all the big thoughts and come up with world-changing massive-action plans. But please know that it’s often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you.

If you find even the smallest way to make people smile, they’ll remember you more for that smile than for all your other fancy business-model stuff.

Don’t try to impress an invisible jury of MBA professors. It’s OK to be casual.

There’s a benefit to being naive about the norms of the world—deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do.

It’s about being, not having.

When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won’t understand. They’ll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way. But that’s forgetting about the joy of learning and doing.

When you sign up to run a marathon, you don’t want a taxi to take you to the finish line.

I never again promised a customer that I could do something that was beyond my full control.

To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.

Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be. Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find that person and let her do it.

Trust, but verify. Remember it when delegating.

Delegate, but don’t abdicate.

Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller were at a party at a billionaire’s extravagant estate. Kurt said, “Wow! Look at this place! This guy has everything!” Joseph said, “Yes, but I have something he’ll never have…enough.”

Business is as creative as the fine arts. You can be as unconventional, unique, and quirky as you want. A business is a reflection of the creator.

Whatever you make, it’s your creation, so make it your personal dream come true.
