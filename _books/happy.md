desc: This is one of the best books I’ve read in the last two years. Profound, life-changing ideas here. It’s a lot of Stoicism, but Brown wraps it in with philosophy and grander ideas in a way that I found totally original and, frankly, brilliant.

We are, each of us, a product of the stories we tell ourselves

‘The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of the parents’ - Carl Jung

Perhaps the first mark of emotional maturity is to realise that there is an enormous gulf between the events of the world and what we do with them. Out There and In Here are two very different kingdoms, and other people are not accountable for how we feel

‘Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.’ - Schopenhauer

You are always editing what you see and what you take in.

View your life story with skepticism.

Learned helplessness - when we feel from previous experience that we’re ‘no good’ at a task, we act out that helpless role when we are faced with it again

We can give ourselves permission to change our story.

Confirmation bias occurs when we notice things in the world that support our beliefs and pay less attention to things that contradict them

While it remains clear that having less than you need is a source of unhappiness, having more than you need does not make you happier.”

If there is a secret to happiness, it isn’t that the universe is a catalogue from which we can order a new car or coffee shop. The real secret might be to accept the indifference of the universe and delight just as much in the coffee shop not appearing

Plan for success; prepare for failure. The universe doesn’t care either way

Your happiness levels are largely defined by the balance of your personality

‘There is perhaps nothing worse than reaching the top of the ladder and discovering that you’re on the wrong wall’ - Joseph Cambell

We equate persistent commitment and the ability to laugh at one’s detractors with a recipe for success. But this is a lie.

Arthur Schopenhauer: Events and our chief aims can be in most cases compared to two forces that pull in different directions, their resultant diagonal being the course of our life

You do not have the control over your life that you might like to believe. You will of course have certain aims, pulling you in one direction. However, life is constantly pulling back in the other.

By projecting ourselves always into the hereafter we miss out on the present, on knowing ourselves and the richness of the current moment. By trying to control what we can’t, we all but guarantee frustration and disappointment

We want something, we perhaps get it, we feel good for a while and then return to whatever default level of happiness or sadness we enjoyed before

Our desires are relative. We spend so much energy and time seeking the approval of our peers.

Wealth is like sea-water; the more we drink, the thirstier we become; and the same is true of fame

You need a change of soul, not a change of climate

‘That the image we had before us of a bright and happy future either excluded us altogether, like the over-saturated images on the resort website, or contained a strange smiling version of ourselves that was not really us at all.’ - Alain de Botton

Happiness is a chimera: it is imaginary and deceiving in many of its forms.

We need a plan to become happier.

We must take concious authorship of our stories. Leading a considered life is about getting our story right for ourselves. It’s as simple as that.

We have two selves that both operate within us: the experiencing self and the remembering self. We don’t make decisions based on our experiences. We make them based on the stories of our experiences. It is this remembering self with which we should be more concerned. Mere pampering to the experiencing self is not enough; we want memories too.


We rely on our remembering self when we consider those stories we have internalised about ourselves; we join the dots in such a way that gives us our sense of identity.

When an activity allows us to steer an x=y diagonal, we find ourselves happily in this ‘flow’ state, avoiding the tedium that arises when our skills outweigh the challenges we face, as well as the anxiety that follows when our obstacles become too great for us

Schopenhauer’s philosophy is based on the revelation of a primal Will that can be identified as the power that propels everything in the universe. A considered life is one in which we aspire to aims other than the procreation and fame that the Will amply encourages, avoiding the swing from pain to boredom and back that would carry us passively through life like a plastic bag in the wind.

We don’t pay much conscious attention to the mental picture we carry around of ourselves, but it dictates so much of how we feel about our strengths and weaknesses

The sign of the true expert is his modest awareness of how much more there is to know; how complex and nuanced the subject at hand insists on remaining

If our walls are severely cracked, no amount of wallpaper will solve the problem.

Psychology lends itself to a horizontal view of happiness. Philosophy lends itself to a vertical approach.

There is no dress rehearsal for life.

Life is too brief to not consider how to experience it at its best

Nietzsche’s ‘eternal recurrence’: would you live your life over and over again exactly as it happened?

HISTORY OF HAPPINESS

Socrates gave life to the very idea of the desire for happiness.

Dionysus v Apollo - Apollo is Edward Norton in Fight Club; Dionysus is Brad Pitt. Many of the conflicts within us can be seen as a result of these opposing urges pulling us in opposing directions, and an important part of life involves recognising and respecting the power and validity of both, rather than denouncing one and attempting to live entirely by the other.

Plato still informs our notion of truth. Seeing what’s real as something separate from our mere experience (shadows of The Cave) is built into the foundations of our two major ways of seeking truth: religion and science.

Using Plato to overcome crush: we can recognise what it is we like about somebody (some aspect of their beauty, or their goodness, or intelligence, or wit) and admire it as a quality quite separate from that particular person, rather than confusing it with him or her. We are not dealing with an ideal Form but a mere shadow cast on the wall. Once our idealised impressions of a person are loosened up in this way, we can make better decisions regarding what to do about them

Aristotle’s encouraged us to look inwards to find out what matters most

In Raphael’s famous fresco The School of Athens: Plato points to the sky, Aristotle to the ground

We judge something to be good if it does well the thing that it is uniquely designed to do. Aristotle says for humans that using reason to ensure happiness (virtues).

Aristotle’s telos (our lives as a work in progress): there is a deeper happiness to be had in knowing that your life is part of a story of flourishing than there is in merely pursuing entertainment.

The problem with Aristotle (as moderns) is he does not take into account the turbid domain of the unconscious

Epicurus: we have nothing more than our animalistic bodily senses to put to use. If we pay attention to what they tell us, we will find that the good life, of the highest pleasure, also happens to be the simplest.

Stoics taught, along with the Epicureans, that we should limit our desires, and that perceived problems in life are due to errors in judgement about those problems

Original sin is a profoundly toxic picture; I cannot imagine a more damaging story for a culture to create for itself than the idea that every one of its members is inherently evil.

We once again owe the idea of ‘being born bad’ to St Augustine. It has never been entirely cleared from our consciousness.

In many ways the Enlightenment was a product of the religious model it so proudly overcame. The striving towards the rewards of Heaven was now replaced with the notion of progress towards a secular kind of salvation: discoveries of science that awaited us and which would lead us to a promised land.

The problem with Bentham’s utilitarianism: if all happiness is subjective, and goodness merely a question of calculating how much happiness a certain act might bring, then what of virtue? With no divine breath to animate and steer us, is man no more than a kind of automaton, a machine without a soul.

Non-believers might scoff at religious people who believe that sacred statues and other icons supernaturally connect them to the divinities for whom such objects stand as mystic avatars. But we are still prone to the same superstitious thinking. To appreciate this, try taking a knife and repeatedly stabbing a photograph of a loved one, and preferably one who has recently passed away. You’ll soon appreciate the power of the graven image.

We don't a ‘God-shaped hole’ within us, but a ‘meaning-shaped hole’ because we are story-forming creatures, and stories should not meander without a point

‘Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing’ - John Stuart Mill.

‘It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it, and calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human life becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more abundant aliment [nourishment] to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by making the race infinitely better worth belonging to. In proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others’ - John Stuart Mill

We should look to developing and strengthening those parts of us that feel unique, not as an aggressive stance against society but with the warm glow of knowing that we can contribute more to it as a distinct, idiosyncratic individual.

The differences between people in a relationship can be precisely the substance of what makes it valuable.

Mill: happiness is a by-product of the process of individual liberation from the levelling demands of society.

Rousseau: we should go back to our original, care-free state. Society is a destroyer of the ‘authenticity’ of human beings.

Reactions against movements tend to inherit their structure. Rousseau reacted against the enlightenment, but his belief that we could obtain happiness through our endeavours is a product of the Enlightenment. Second, something of the prelapsarian lingers in the Romantics’ reverence for the childhood innocence they deem necessary for the attainment of true joy. Augustine’s doctrine of original sin was still at work, in disguised form, nearly fifteen hundred years after he imposed it upon us, in this hankering after some lost state of unworldliness.

Schopenhauer: art can free us from the tyranny of the Will that otherwise drives us to merely satisfy our base desires

Marx: work is an activity that is supposed to endow us with happiness and a sense of humanity. (A reaction against capitalism, but now part of capitalism.)

Employment is no longer merely a means to an end, as it was in pre-Enlightenment days; it is now supposed to be a source of happiness in and of itself. But the moment we expect that we should do for a living what we enjoy, we unfairly cast those who do not have that advantage as failures. Perhaps because our first question upon meeting people tends to be ‘What do you do?’, and because this is taken to mean ‘What do you do for a living?’, we are used to being judged on the basis of our jobs

We can take comfort in the knowledge that for the vast sweep of human history it did not occur to people that they were supposed to enjoy their work. Our daily employment does not need to be our identity.

What counts is not the work but our relationship to it. Schopenhauer ascribed far more importance to what one does with one’s leisure. The ideal he describes is to be wealthy enough to have expansive free time and the intellectual capabilities to fill it with contemplation and activity in the service of mankind.

Nietzsche: we are ourselves the authors of our nature, and must grasp that responsibility.

Above all, Freud’s legacy is one of empathy: he forever altered our treament of psychological dis-ease and restored dignity to sufferers.

Freud reminds us that that we are all troubled souls in one way or another. Even successful people.

Freud and Schopenhauer share the x=y diagonal of life.

Today: Kahneman’s experiencing self finds itself the centre of attention, while our story-forming remembering half remains unnourished. We are no longer pointed towards the profound; we are distracted from it or too easily able to drown out its call.

THE STOICS

Epicurus: to become happier, we need to reassess our attachments to things in the world.

We live in an age where ‘conspicuous consumption’ (the purchasing of goods to display our economic success) and ‘invidious consumption’ (purchasing in order to make others envy us) are so commonplace we barely notice we’re engaging in them.

‘The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum’ - Chomsky

New is exciting; new is intense; new promises to interrupt the monotony of that hedonic treadmill (whilst spinning it endlessly) and distracts us from the fact that our lives tend to be, unless we choose to do anything about it, rather dull and predictable.

Remove the desire to impress others and live a more authentic life.

‘Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.’ - Epicurus

You might come to value it more by choosing to leave it at home when you go out for dinner or a walk. Aside from the rewarding feeling of connection with the real world that you will feel (bolstered by the smugness of seeing everyone else fixated upon theirs), you will appreciate it more upon your return

Keeping our desires simple makes us less fearful of what the ancients called ‘fortune’: with less to worry about, the unpredictable nature of life is less likely to bother us. If we only care about things which are truly necessary to us, we will be less affected by disasters.

‘Those who possess the power of securing themselves completely from their neighbours, live most happily with one another, since they have this constant assurance’ - Lucretius?

The important thing is that we act from a point of virtue (as opposed to pursuing pleasure), by which we mean psychological robustness.

The first building block: If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now.

We tell ourselves stories about external events.

Unite emotion and intellect: if emotions will change and shift as beliefs are modified, then we can see them as fundamentally rational. We decide if certain emotions are reasonable or unreasonable.

Marcus Aurelius: reconsider our judgements in a way that helps us.

You are responsible for your unhappiness.

‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way’ - Viktor E. Frankl

Marcus tells himself to see those things that infuriate him as no more than the equivalent of sawdust and wood clippings on the floor of a carpenter’s workshop.

The second building block: Don’t try to change things you cannot control.

Only concern ourselves with things that we can control. All else should be of no interest.

Under our control are our thoughts and actions. Not under our control is everything else.

We have already looked at the things that lie within our control, namely our thoughts and actions, and how we take charge of these by distinguishing between ‘appearances’ and ‘impressions’: between external events and our interpretations of those events. But now we have a huge coda to that thought: nothing else matters.

When we let things go that we can’t control, nothing bad happens. The situation can’t get any worse, and generally we get to feel an awful lot better. For me, the relief I feel when I remind myself that a source of annoyance is fine, is none of my business, is akin to the surge of joy that would fill my lungs as a child when I realised it was a Saturday and I didn’t have to go to school.

‘The best advice for fellow actors is this: know what your job is … An actor is supposed to create a compelling and interesting character that serves the text and to present it in the environment where your audition happens, and then you walk away. That’s it. Everything else that happens is out of your control, so don’t even think of that, don’t focus on that.
You’re not going there to get a job. You’re going there to present what you do. You act. And there it is. And walk away. There’s power in that …
It’s also saying ‘I can only do so much’, and then the decision of who might get a job is so out of your control that … it makes no sense to hold on to that …
Once I adopted that philosophy, I never looked back, and I’ve never been busier in my life’ - Bryan Cranston on a stoic framework for auditions

‘I will be the nicest and friendliest person I can be around people.’ Beyond that, how they choose to respond to me is their business, not mine.

We may lose our job and have to sell our home; we may lose or break our possessions and have to do without. Their continued existence in our lives is not guaranteed. We must let go of the attachment we feel.

We can look at the things and people we value each day with the knowledge that we will most likely lose them at some point, and love them all the more for that.

It is only the finite nature of our relationships that gives them their meaning. Bittersweet transience lends context and value.

It is permissible to prefer certain external things such as wealth, family and social position, as long as one doesn’t become attached to them.

Externals are indifferent. Let’s not mince words: if we are ill, or a loved one dies, this is ultimately a matter of no importance to fate and the machinations of the universe.

The well-being of ourselves and others may be to us a ‘preferred indifferent’, and thus something to be enjoyed or secured where convenient, but it is ultimately an indifferent because it does not occupy that realm of actions and thoughts that is uniquely our concern.

We should not get too attached to our ambitions and realise that our tiny aims are an insignificant part of the myriad of plans that make up the grand scheme of fortune.

Amor fati - the love of fate.

A key to living more happily is to simply decide that you are very happy with reality per se.

Marcus Aurelius: Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions.

When we combine this with an attitude of openness, it will allow us to connect in the best possible way with the human race at large.

In one instance, it may serve us to see fate as rolling on throughout history without our involvement, and to accept that events in the world happen as they ought to. In another, it may benefit us more to know that our actions make a difference and that our choices do matter. We can hold both opposing models in our mind; it matters not if neither quite tells the full story, or the reality exists somewhere between or in some quantum space quite separate from the two.

The first, most fundamental decision we should make is to engage more often in a silent dialogue with ourselves. We need to be able to step back and recognise when we are making choices as to how to behave or think, or acknowledge when an unhelpful choice has been made and supply counter-arguments to remedy the situation.

The two big questions when we are feeling down:
1. What am I doing to give myself this feeling?
2. Is this thing that’s upsetting me something which lies under my control? If not, what if I were to decide it’s fine and let it go?

Do not say more to yourself than the first impressions report. Stop devising stories that further upset us.

‘You will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realise how seldom they do’ - David Foster Wallace

So much of our unhappiness comes from ruminating over past events or worrying about possible future ones.

Past: guilt
Future: fear

If we have let ourselves down, it is difficult, but highly therapeutic, to admit as much to ourselves and realise we could have done better; we make a mental note for next time, apologise if need be to the people concerned, and move on. We are fallible human beings and will make mistakes for the rest of our lives.

When we find ourselves worrying or anxious: ‘Do I have a problem right now?’

If we only use these techniques at the moments we most need them, we are unlikely to make them part of the fabric of our lives.

Stoicism’s aim is not an emotionless detachment from others but about living in harmony with Nature and being a productive part of humankind.

Prepare for the day ahead with premeditation. Sit and take the time to think ahead to the events we expect this day to bring. Consider the events and people we will meet today from a distance and while our centre of gravity is within us. What is in our control and what is not? Where, today, are we in danger of letting ourselves down and acting in a way that we would later regret? What are the alternatives, which we can mentally rehearse now and more easily employ when the time is right?

‘What evils have you cured yourself of today? What vices have you fought? In what sense are you better?’ - Seneca

A regular period of quiet solitude helps create a bedrock of self-sufficiency that accompanies us into the social hours ahead. If we are able to find time and space each day to redress the balance, and if we use it to remind ourselves that so much of our life has nothing to do with us, and that it is only with our thoughts and actions that we need to concern ourselves, we will soon find that our centre of gravity returns to its correct place.

Use 1st and 3rd person perspective during morning meditation. To consider difficult upcoming or past events without feeling the anguish, try switching to that third-person, CCTV point of view. When you come to rehearse a new, more positive response, resume the first-person perspective and view everything as you would through your own eyes, making it all as vivid as you can.

Make time each day to improve the mind. Anything we might find educative.

ANGER

Anger is by far the most destructive and pervasive of the passions. Frustration is related but (slightly) weaker.

Without the desire for retribution we are not really experiencing anger.

On anger & injustice: an artist sees the world and notices a difference between how she feels it should be and how it actually is. The work of art she creates is a way of bridging the gap: a physical manifestation of that discrepancy. The emotions she experiences, which might of course be very pleasant and far from anger, are nonetheless channelled into something constructive, and the observer of the final piece might be challenged to pay attention to the issues in question and align himself with the artist’s motivations. MLK dealt with volatile, highly charged emotions, but he and other motivators of non-violent protest are engaging in an essentially creative, visionary process.

Anger gets in the way of us making our point. It will defeat our objective: to express ourselves convincingly. Our intelligence has been banished when we are in the grip of anger.

The real culprit here is our sense of entitlement. Eye for an eye is not a thing.

Given the importance we tend to ascribe to how we come across to other people, it is astonishing that we are so hostile to honest feedback. If we wish to make progress with a character trait, such as minimising anger, we would be well advised to start asking trusted friends how we’re doing.

ANGER TACTIC #1: WAIT

Perhaps the most widely recommended technique for nipping anger in the bud is to simply wait. Anger is a leaky bucket: it gets filled, can overflow if we keep topping it up, but if we give it time, our anger will dribble away.

Perhaps it would help us to call anger by another name: panic.

Remember that the point of delay is to spare others a misjudged response, not an excuse to merely sulk.

Expressing our unhappiness in a sensitive way is one of the most productive things we can do in a relationship.

ANGER TACTIC #2: RESIST CURIOSITY

Another approach to not being disturbed by anger might be to entirely avoid it in the first place.

The act of eavesdropping brings with it a set of appropriate physiological responses that remind us we are doing something we shouldn’t. We should feel the same response when we read comments about ourselves online

Muting is a Stoic move: it makes no attempt to control what is beyond me and simply removes me from any feelings of irritation

It’s enormously liberating to not feed the beast. When our ears prick up, practise resisting curiosity.

To not flail and blame but acknowledge our responsibility for our emotions is not only a mark of maturity but the only path to relieving distress.

What separates childish stories from real life is that the characters of fairy tales are impossibly one-dimensional; they tend to stand as potent symbols of forces that might figure in a child’s psyche. The people with whom we share our lives, on the other hand, are as complex and contradictory as we are ourselves. Motivations are rarely black and white, and our futures are seldom, if ever, as drastically and obviously cast as we imagine.

ANGER TACTIC #3: USE IMAGINARY FRIENDS

We might use a friend, an admired luminary, even a fictitious character, as a role model who can spring to mind when we find ourselves incensed. How might they deal with this situation? This might give us some distance from our own story and offer a more helpful, convincing perspective. Or, if a friend were suffering with this particular problem, how would we advise them? Those calming words of wisdom we would offer – what would they be?

ANGER TACTIC #4: LOWER YOUR SELF-BELIF

‘You ask what is the greatest failing in you? You keep accounts badly: you rate high what you have paid out but low what you have been paid.’ - Seneca

Perhaps the greatest cause of anger and frustration is our inflated sense of our own entitlement.

Our centre of gravity must be brought inside where it belongs.

The vast majority of us are drawn to basic qualities such as warmth and openness.

A large part of improving the ‘self’ is to shift the focus from ‘self’ to ‘other’

We do not need to be right.

ANGER TACTIC #5: YOU HAVE THE SAME FAULTS AS THOSE WHO ANNOY YOU

We’re not so different.

Marcus Aurelius: When you run against someone’s wrong behaviour, go on at once to reflect what similar wrong act of your own there is

Seneca alerts us to how much anger can be avoided if we first say to ourselves in silence: ‘I myself have also been guilty of this’

ANGER TACTIC #6: UNDERSTANDING THE OFFENDER’S MOTIVATION

‘When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you’ll have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?’ - Marcus Aurelius

We can’t blame others for doing what we would most likely have done if we found ourselves in the same circumstances. If we had been that annoyed, or that protective, or felt cornered or scared to the same degree, we would have done the same thing. Under the same psychological conditions, would have very likely done the same.

Approach offenders as fellow human beings.

ANGER TACTIC #7: LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS

In the same way that we can adjust our desires in life to more accurately reflect what is available, we can also adjust our expectations of other people to mirror reality.

As we get excited about a planned or expected future event, it’s a good thing to remind ourselves – unless it doesn’t work out.

‘Do not seek to have events happen to you as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well’ - Epictetus

We can only guarantee success in trying our best.

Anger is just proof of how unrealistic your expectations were.

EMPATHY AND CONNECTEDNESS

Being kind creates more pleasure for us than pain.

‘Soon we will spit out this little spirit. In the meantime, while we have breath, while we are among our fellow men, let us behave as men should; let us not be a cause of fear or danger to anyone; let us despise losses, wrongs, insult and criticism, and let us tolerate with a great mind our short-lived misfortunes.’ - Seneca

‘In this world which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don’t like. We can only live together in that way – and if we are to live together and not die together, we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.’ - Bertrand Russell

We overestimate our capacity to feel empathically about another person’s situation.

We can be an unassailable rock some of the time and a rolling pebble on other occasions. Whatever helps us the most. We relieve some of the Stoic tension by allowing the rocks of our analogies to be porous. The porous rock gives us an image of both strength and confluence, and as the water (of fortune and of others’ influence) flows through us, we remain steady without a need for defiance.

The appeal of street photography lies in noticing the poetry of the everyday.

FAME  

Celebrity serves as a helpful distraction from the material inequalities of real life.

Once we’re ‘inside’, once we’re famous, it’s still us looking back out.

My main aims have always been rooted in the present: whether or not things are organised at the moment in a way that seems right, or fun, or both.

We indirectly find happiness in the absence of a stressor (money troubles) not in the having of something.

Treat fame and riches as pleasant side effects.

These urges – to transform ourselves and connect with something larger than our familiar, humdrum lives – are primal longings to which religion once effectively paid heed. Today, these cries from the soul go largely unheard; hence we understandably attach them to the accumulation of wealth.

Become more aware of what our priorities are: what we need to flourish. Some commodities will help us do that, and they may indeed be expensive or appear luxurious to others.

The formula for success: TALENT + ENERGY

The development of your talent and the energy with which you approach that aspect of your life are of course two things that are under your control. Success itself is not.

Aim to psychologically manoeuvre yourself into a position where developing your talent and balancing it with suitable energy provide you with enough enjoyment, happiness and money to get by.

The formula for being a star: STYLE + ATTITUDE

If you are anxious, you are fixating on the uncertainties of the future.


DEATH

If we wish to enjoy a considered life, we must be able to step back and see an overall shape to our allotted span. Mortality provides that shape and can surprise us by being the wellspring of deep meaning, value and joy.

‘What terrifies most about death is not the loss of the future but the loss of the past. In fact, the act of forgetting is a form of death always present within life’ - Milan Kundera

Fairy tales instil in us at an early age a sense of fairness that doesn’t match with the real world. The reality is that good and bad things happen to all people.

One of the qualities of death is that it does not bring with it any closure. It does not bring our lives to an end in the way the last chapter of a novel or the last scenes of a film wind up the story and give meaning to the events that have come before. Death does not allow our lives to come to some sort of fruition. It simply curtails life. It may stop it in its tracks quite suddenly, or we might be permitted to hear the trundling of its dark carriage from a distance, but it does not complete the story for us. That’s for us to do, if we are given the chance.

The positing of a spiritual plane sounds like a symptom of our very human wish that there must be more to this world than the everyday things that make up our lives. We want to be sure that somehow it must all add up and have some meaning not obvious to us now.

Religious symbols have become forms of idolatry, mistaken for the destination, when they were only intended as signposts.

What God might have once meant has long disappeared. Nietzsche’s famous declaration that ‘God is Dead’ was lamenting this very issue.

We can still view spirituality (in regard to having a sense of meaning, and a conscious dialogue with what lies beneath) as an important internal experience, perhaps more important than ever in this age of addiction and distraction.

pheonmenal world: the world of phenomena - what we perceive (infinite)
noumenal world: the world of actual things as they truly are

2-dimensional world would see a 3-d baloon passing through as a circle appearing, growing larger, then disappearing. We live in a three-dimensional world. The fourth dimension (our equivalent of the balloon) is time; it’s the next dimension up from us. A space-time worm of our whole life. Fifth dimension is all possibile lives shooting out a star. And up from there.

Time and space are like filters we apply to the world to make sense of it. They describe the world of objects. This table is here, the lady making an espresso is over there. I was in my hotel room before I came here, I will be on stage soon after I leave. The person is an adult after he has been a child. We speak from the limitations of our perspective.

There is no ‘after’ outside the Matrix. ‘After’ is a word we use to describe how we organise the world of everyday things (which are contained inside the Matrix). There can be no ‘afterlife’, because there is no ‘after’ once we get into that noumenal world of things-in-themselves.

Defenders of the after-life want to have it both ways: on the one hand, they wish to describe a fundamental reality that operates beneath the everyday world we perceive. On the other, they wish to retain the everyday world’s organisational language.

Epicurus is pointing out to us a common mistake he thinks we make: that we tend to imagine ourselves as dead (rotting in the ground and so on) and feel fear or revulsion. But he says this is a silly error: we will have neither that experience of decomposition, nor of the flames of the crematorium. By the time it happens, we simply won’t exist.

We have all had experience of a kind of non-existence. Every night when we sleep deeply, we could be said to cease having any sense of personhood. Although our bodies continue some level of fundamental functioning, we might as well be dead as far as our on-going experience goes. The idea of a profound, dreamless sleep does not scare us. If we knew that everyone was going to go to sleep for a year and that we’d all wake up well and happy and free from bedsores, would we be scared of doing so? We’d have no obvious reason to feel fear. What if, then, we could sleep profoundly and dreamlessly for a trillion years and awaken with the brightest of eyes and bushiest of tails, the same age we were when we got into bed, with nothing having changed?

But this argument is not entirely satisfying, is it? It’s worth getting to the heart of why it isn’t quite right, because if we look deeper, we’ll get richer answers: a sense of what it is about death that does disturb us, and therefore what we should learn to face.

The idea of dying makes no sense unless we presume that death will happen at the end of it. That’s what dying is. So we may insist that it’s the dying we fear, but would we really fear it if we knew we would emerge alive and well at the end?

.We’ve been in the eternal abyss once before, and we don’t feel any regret about it. So why fear returning? This is known as the symmetry argument. What ‘happens to us’ after death symmetrically reflects what ‘happened to us’ before birth.

But we feel very differently about pain that has happened in the past and pain that is yet to come.

An abyss of nothingness ahead of us, then, is not the same to us as one that’s been and gone in the past.

Death deprives us of seeing our projects come to some sort of fruition, and of engaging in fresh ones. It stings in a way that the prenatal abyss does not.

DEATH GIVES US MEANING (CONSIDER IMMORTALITY):

But immortality is not the answer: something in us would look forward and find that without the framework provided by precious finite time, all engagements would be fruitless.

What makes love so compelling? The fact that this is the one, short life we have and that we might spend a large part of it with this other person.

In general, the intensity and dedication with which very many human activities are pursued cannot be explained without reference to the awareness that our opportunities are finite, that we cannot choose these activities indefinitely many times.

Everything worthwhile in your life draws its meaning from the fact you will die. We need death in order to live.

‘A life without temporal boundaries would be no more a life than a circle without a circumference would be a circle.’ - Samuel Scheffler

That immortality would be bad for us is a fact. There seems no way round that.

The very notion of transience is fundamental to human experience. Yet death seems bad for us because it deprives us of what we instinctively want: permanence.

Transience also opens the way to melancholy: a rich aspect of our experience that offers up a peculiar form of beauty. Melancholy is caught up with the passing of time, nostalgia, and a knowledge that all things must end.

Music is perhaps the most obvious vessel for this melancholy richness, because music (unlike a painting) is inseparable from transience, in that it moves through time.

J. S. Bach’s Cello Suites, the Aria from the Goldberg Variations and the ‘Erbarme Dich’ from his St Matthew Passion; Chopin’s Nocturnes; Messiaen’s Quatour pour la Fin de Temps; Górecki’s Third Symphony – composers have always nourished the interlacing of beauty and sadness. Lyrics only add more melancholy content: Richard Strauss’s ‘Morgen’ and the Vier Letzte Lieder; Tom Waits’ Closing Time and the songs of Rufus Wainwright; Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius; the strains and pains of sex and death in Wagner’s operas.


‘A flower that blossoms only for a single night does not seem to us on that account less lovely’ - Freud

We value beautiful things because they have a certain emotional effect on us in the moment; they do not need to persist beyond that moment to be worthwhile. Their value exists outside of time.

Life is growth, and if it does not involve a perpetual passing away, then we can neither grow nor live in any meaningful sense. And eventually, by accepting this truth in our honest grief, we will be ready to let the first rays of light penetrate the darkness.

We don’t live with death as a companion, and so we fear it as an unwelcome, unbidden outsider when it comes. Without the cultural rituals in place to give death some form of meaning it is down to us to each identify and complete our own story.

If you are facing your own death, and have the clarity of mind and opportunity to make such choices, then realise that for you to own your death, to author it and to shape it, is tremendously important.

Medical authors Atul Gawande and David Kuhl have both written beautiful books about death and the experience of dying patients. B. J. Miller, of the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco, gives a truly magnificent TED talk on the subject.

To align ourselves along that x=y axis through life, shifting our expectations to work with reality, reminding ourselves that things may not work out as we expect, that we may lose the things we value, that things come and go: all this we know is to aim for a kind of tranquillity. This ideal not only serves us in life; it is also preparation for death. If we have throughout our life, here and there and within the limits of our ability, practised this easier relationship with fortune, it can place us in good stead for our final stages, greatly mitigate our fears and allow us to experience the rich fullness of the present when it is offered to us most starkly.

REGRETS

THE TOP 5 REGRETS OF THE DYING:
I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.
I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.
I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
I wish that I had let myself be happier.

It is not ‘correct’ to live in the moment, for the very reason that we are storytellers and right now is always part of a continuing narrative. We know from Kahneman’s work on the remembering and experiencing selves that how you look back on this moment will be more conducive to deciding if it’s a happy one than how you feel about it right now.

However, being open to the opportunities of the present, at least sometimes and where appropriate and possible, does save us from leading a life that merely happens in the interim; one in which that same narrative drive keeps us lurching forward, while we worry where it’s all going to end up.

We can be aware of how we are likely to later judge our current actions and check that we’re not wasting time with things that evidently do not matter.

If you have something to ‘come out’ about, come out. If you carry a secret around with you, you learn to protect it in all sorts of ways that disconnect you from the rest of the world and the people in it.

You’ll never regret falling in love. Do so over and over again. Lower your standards if necessary. It might lead to heartbreak now and then, but it’ll always be worth it in the end.

If you work in a creative field, and you are faced with a choice of doing a job for the money or doing a job for the fun of it, take the fun one whenever you can. You’ll rarely enjoy the work you do for money.

Don’t be a dick. People around you are not there to make your life easier. Everyone is fighting a hard battle; everyone is just trying to do their best, in the same way that you are. If you treat people with compassion you are likely to feel better and your life will be noticeably happier.


There is rarely a right and wrong. Most times there’s just a jumble of viewpoints, and it’s okay to grant others the validity you grant yours, and to tolerate the contradiction.

Look at what takes up your time and see what is worth doing and what is not. Think about what provides enjoyment, connectivity, a sense of fulfilment, and what, when you look back, will have been a waste of time or stifled you. Look for ways of removing those latter activities from your life.

Most of the time we exist in the everyday mode and might marvel at how things are in the world. However, in the ontological mode (‘ontology’ is the study of what it is to be), we stand back and look at the marvellous fact that things, and we, exist. Our attention is turned from the physical trappings of daily life to the deeper questions of being, and in this mode we are more likely to make worthwhile changes in our life.


Our past is a story that we tell ourselves in the present. We create it every day when we accept the narratives we have developed about who we are and why we are who we are.

Whatever the past is, it has been and gone. If there are things you need to face in your past because they refuse to let you go, realise at least that they grip you not because they control you (they no longer exist), but because of the narrative they’ve left you with. You can’t change what happened, but you can gain a little distance from it by reassessing your story about it.

Consciously note the way your unconscious machinations bring old patterns to the fore, and then, where you can, quietly smile at them. Be grateful to your unconscious for looking out for you, while also acknowledging that it’s being hilariously oversensitive.

By bringing an unconscious process into the light of conscious attention, we undo its power.

The present moment can be a more productive place to focus our attention. The here and now, we have seen, rarely contains problems; it is released from the tyranny of our imposing narratives.

As storytelling, project-forming beings, we would deny our humanity if we disregarded the yet-to-come, which, containing our eventual death, provides the circumference to our circle. But to be released from the grip of it, and to be more awake to opportunity and change where they help us, we will need to gently increase our attention to the present.

If we feel a bias against the elderly, we are feeling it against our future selves. And, if we look at our lives as great space-time worms, we can forget the ‘future’ part of that description and see it as simply an aversion towards ourselves.

The present is a fact; the future is contingent. While an antidote to a fear of death is to embrace the present, we cannot remain there for long. At some point we want to know what use the current objects of our attention are to us, or how they might affect us for better or for worse, or how they compare to what we have seen before; and with these new thoughts we disconnect from the now and give over to our imaginations. This is why we can only aim for ‘good enough’ when it comes to embracing the present, for short of somehow remaining in a state of permanent focused meditation, we will always need to look forwards.

RETHINKING THE AFTERLIFE

Even ‘we’ might be said to live on after our deaths in the sense that those who know us now will carry around their memory of us after we’ve gone. And what that will mean depends on how we affect others now while we are alive.

If a person’s behaviour has touched us in some way, we are often keen to have the same effect on others. Irvin D. Yalom calls this ‘rippling’: creating concentric circles of influence that ‘can affect others for years, even for generations’.

Yalom: ‘Perhaps death was not quite the annihilation she had thought. Perhaps it was not so essential that her person or even memories of her person survived. Perhaps the important thing was that her ripples persist, ripples of some act or idea that would help others attain joy and virtue in life, ripples that would fill her with pride and act to counter the immorality, horror and violence monopolising the mass media and the outside world’

If we have the opportunity, we can make sure that despite the effect we may have had on a person in the past, we can finish the story well and ripple positively into that person. As many of us will not have that opportunity when the time comes, we can choose to pay attention to this idea in the present and do our best to ripple positively now, where and while we can.

James [asteroid-post-death thought experiment] feels, as does Scheffler [children of men], that our understanding of human life as a whole ‘relies on an implicit understanding of such a life as itself occupying a place in an ongoing human history, in a temporally extended chain of lives and generations’

It is not merely enough that we have in place the temporal finitude provided by our own death to ensure our lives have meaning. It is not enough that we die. We also need others to live on after us and without us. We need to die and others need to live. Which means ultimately that the continuing lives of others matter more to us than do our own.

Where we cannot do anything about our own demise, there is much we can do about preserving the future of humanity.

If we accept ourselves – our consciousness – as patterns of thinking, then our ‘self’ is something that to one degree or other can be experienced by other people too.

If I were to lose a daughter, and every day I found myself reminded of her, and if I were to think about what she would say or do about this or that, then my pattern for a while becomes hers. And thus her consciousness – her pattern – her self – is recreated in me for a while. It’s sadly a coarse, grainy, much-reduced version of her, but it is, in some sense, her.

We resurrect our loved ones whenever we find ourselves thinking and feeling like them. We carry them with us, in that blueprint of how to think and feel that they have left behind. And the closer we are to them, the more we understand them, the more accurate that blueprint will be. It turns out, then, to be the positive connections between people that provide the mechanism for our ‘self’ to survive death in any meaningful way. It turns out to be love.



We prefer the illusion of black-and-white thinking to the real-life complexities of the grey in-betweens. To grow up is to endure the equivocal, to permit the ambiguous.

Mindfulness is just paying deliberate attention in the present: noticing things. When we are mindful, we turn off our autopilot and switch back on. Suddenly the world blooms before us.

Mindfulness challenges the stories we tell ourselves by having us pay attention to the larger picture, which is only accessible in the here and now.

Being granted authorship of our stories, and experiencing mindfulness rather than mindlessness, makes for happier and healthier lives.

Our ultimate aim is maybe not so much to be happy as to live fully and make sure we are moving forward.

To live without anxiety is to live without growth. We shouldn’t try to control what we cannot, and we must take responsibility for our feelings. But the reason for this is to walk out into the world with strength, not to hide from danger.

Anxiety is a signal that we are not in harmony with ourselves. Who is? It is good to detach from worthless sources of worry but also vital for our flourishing to listen to those rumblings and see from whence they arise.

‘[After sadness passes] one might easily suppose that nothing had happened, but we have altered the way a house alters when a guest enters it. We cannot say who has come, perhaps we will never know, but there are indications that it is the future that enters into us like this, in order to be transformed within us, long before it actually occurs’ - Rilke

The final call, then, is not to merely seek tranquillity but, from its strong shores, to welcome its opposite. It is a strong society that encourages dialogue with its enemies, and a fearful one that promulgates reductive nouns and categories (such as ‘Terror’) to demonise and avoid the unsettling complexities of active, untidy reality. We, too, must seek the same conversation within ourselves. And do so before the forces we repress rage against us.
