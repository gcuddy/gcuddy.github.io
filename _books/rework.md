‘The real world isn’t a place, it’s an excuse.’

‘With so much failure in the air, you can’t help but breathe it in. Don’t inhale.’

‘Success gives you real ammunition.’ Not necessarily mistakes.

‘Unless you’re a fortune-teller, long-term business planning is a fantasy.’

‘Just get on the plane and go. You can pick up a nicer shirt, shaving cream, and a toothbrush once you get there.’

‘What’s wrong with finding the right size and staying there?’

‘Premature hiring is the death of many companies.’

‘Everyone should be encouraged to start his own business, not just some rare breed that self-identifies as entrepreneurs.’

‘To do great work, you need to feel that you’re making a difference.’

‘What you do is your legacy. Don’t sit around and wait for someone else to make the change you want to see.’

‘The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use.’

‘What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.’

“Get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all.” - Stanley Kubrick

‘There’s always enough time if you spend it right.’

‘Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service.’ Be ‘willing to lose some customers if it means that others love our products intensely’.

‘A business without a path to profit isn’t a business, it’s a hobby.’

‘Getting to great starts by cutting out stuff that’s merely good.’

‘The big picture is all you should be worrying about in the beginning.’

‘Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.’

‘The core of your business should be built around things that won’t change.’

‘Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot these by-products and see opportunities.’

‘The worst interruptions of all are meetings.’

Meeting rules: ‘Set a timer. When it rings, meeting’s over. Period. Invite as few people as possible. Always have a clear agenda. Begin with a specific problem. Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes. End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it.’

Judo solution: ‘one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.’

‘Momentum fuels motivation.’

‘Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate.’

To-do list rules: Keep them small. Prioritize visually by putting MIT at top.

‘Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it.’

‘Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers.’

‘Defensive companies can’t think ahead; they can only think behind.’

‘Don’t shy away from the fact that your product or service does less. Highlight it.’

‘Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There’s an endless supply of customers who need exactly that.’

‘The requests that really matter are the ones you’ll hear over and over.’

‘Teach and you’ll form a bond you just don’t get from traditional marketing tactics.’

“Pare down to the essence, but don’t remove the poetry.” - Leonard Koren

‘Be unforgettable. That’s how you’ll get the best coverage.’

‘Emulate drug dealers. Make your product so good, so addictive, so “can’t miss” that giving customers a small, free taste makes them come back with cash in hand.’

‘Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.’

‘Never hire anyone to do a job until you’ve tried to do it yourself first.’
