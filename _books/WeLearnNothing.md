“Idle dreaming is often the essence of what we do.” - Thomas Pynchon

“The essence of creativity *is* fucking around; art is that which is done for the hell of it.”

Soul Toupee - the hidden, embarrassing things about ourselves (p 34)

“Time and quiet should not be luxury items.”

“The best investment of my limited time on earth is to spend it with people I love.”

“I don’t know why we take our worst moods so much more seriously than our best, crediting depression with more clarity than euphoria.”

“It’s like the revelation I had the first time I ever flew in an airplane as a kid: when you break through the cloud cover you realize that above the passing squalls and doldrums there is a realm of eternal sunlight, so keen and brilliant you have to squint against it, a vision to hold on to when you descend once again beneath the clouds, under the oppressive, petty jurisdiction of the local weather.”

“The goal of a life is not to provide material for good stories.”

“Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness: obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.”

“On the best ordinary days of my life, I write in the morning, go for a long bike ride and run errands in the afternoon, and see friends, read, or watch a movie in the evening. This, it seems to me, is a sane and pleasant pace for a day. And if you call me up and ask whether I won’t maybe blow off work and check out the new American Wing at the Met or ogle girls in Central Park or just drink chilled pink minty cocktails all day long, I will say, ‘What time?’”

“We mistakenly imagine we want ‘happiness,’ which we tend to picture in vague, soft-focus terms, when what we really crave is the harder-edged quality of intensity.”

“Maybe one reason artists seem so susceptible to love affairs is that being in love is one of the only times when life is anything like art—when we actually feel the way torch songs and arias sound, the way Gene Kelly looks singing in the rain. It might all have been worth it if I’d been the only one hurt.”

“The very parts of ourselves that we’re most ashamed of and eager to conceal are not only obvious to everyone but are also, quite often, the parts of us they love best.”
See: Vulnerability

“Laughter is one of those intimacies, like orgasm or tears or just getting completely snickered with someone, that bares our most helpless, undignified selves. It’s what’s bound and consecrated all my friendships, the way that sex consummates a love affair.”

“If you manage to make it to some semblance of adulthood, just showing up turns out to be one of the kindest, most selfless things you can do for someone.”

“This is the most poisonous thing that secrets do to us—they isolate us from everyone around us and make us feel even lonelier than we already are.”
