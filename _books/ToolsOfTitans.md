  A long, difficult book to summarize. Not that it’s intellectually dense — it’s just so full of various practical things, of wildly varying usefulness. It’s basically just a collection of quotes from podcast guests. Luckily, Tim gets good guests on his show, so there’s a lot of good material here. I took my favorites from it.

  There’s a lot of trends and patterns on the practical side: meditation, exercise, fasting. I found the section on microdosing to be incredibly fascinating (and echoed in Sam Harris’ section). I also liked some of the more peculiar quotes, like Seth Godin on how to cook better. All in all, I would rather read a book from one of these people, though.

  Naval’s section is the best. Incredibly pithy and profound. I love the idea that busyness of the mind increases the passage of subejctive time.

Arnold: “The worst thing you can ever do is think that you know enough. Never stop learning. Ever.”

“Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can’t see from the center. Big, undreamed-of things—the people on the edge see them first.” —Kurt Vonnegut

“The superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc.) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths.”
GUS: Not sure I agree with this. But it is what it is.

“Hyperthermic conditioning” (calculated heat exposure) can help you to increase growth hormone (GH) levels and substantially improve endurance. I now take ~20-minute sauna sessions post-workout or post-stretching at least four times per week, typically at roughly 160 to 170°F.
GUS: I’ve read mixed studies on this.

When in doubt, work on the deficiencies you’re most embarrassed by.

“Flexibility” can be passive, whereas “mobility” requires that you can demonstrate strength throughout the entire range of motion, including the end ranges.

“If you don’t have cancer and you do a therapeutic fast 1 to 3 times per year, you could purge any precancerous cells that may be living in your body.”

Jason Nemer: If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’d be movement and play. Because you can’t really play without moving, so they’re intertwined. Treadmills kill your spirit. There are reasons and times to do treadmills, but if that is your only way of moving your body, you’re selling yourself short.

PETER ATTIA:

Going 16 hours without eating generally provides the right balance of autophagy (look it up) and anabolism (muscle building).

It’s important to get blood tests often enough to trend, and to repeat/confirm scary results before taking dramatic action.

If you’re over 40 and don’t smoke, there’s about a 70 to 80% chance you’ll die from one of four diseases: heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, or neurodegenerative disease.

There are really two pieces to longevity. The first is delaying death as long as possible by delaying the onset of chronic disease (the ‘big four’ above). We call that the defensive play. The second is enhancing life, the offensive play.

You don’t ever need to run another step a day in your life, because there’s no value in that. There is value in exercise, though, and I think that the most important type of exercise, especially in terms of bang for your buck, is going to be really high-intensity, heavy strength training.

Charles Poliquin: The length of time a doctor spends with you on your first visit is probably your best indicator of their quality

JAMES FADIMAN (psychedelics. this is cool):

Many psychedelics (psilocybin, mescaline, etc.) have been used ceremonially for hundreds or thousands of years by indigenous cultures. More recently, universities around the world have begun testing these molecules for addressing treatment-resistant depression, removing end-of-life anxiety in terminal cancer patients, ending nicotine addiction, and more.

MDMA is not exactly a psychedelic because you don’t leave your identity behind, but it is the single best way to overcome intractable post-traumatic stress disorder.

Microdoses of LSD or mushrooms may be very helpful for depression because they make you feel better enough that you do something about what’s wrong with your life.

There’s a saying in the psychedelic world: “If you get the answer, you should hang up the phone.”

Floatation therapy is an excellent (legal) alternative to pschyedelics.

KELLY STARRETT:

If you wake up and don’t have a boner, there’s a problem. It is an indicator of sleep quality, hormonal health (GH, FSH, testosterone), circadian rhythm timing, and more.

Get zero drop shoes.

JANE MCGONIGAL:
Have trouble getting to sleep? Try 10 minutes of Tetris.

“If you set your goals ridiculously high and it’s a failure, you will fail above everyone else’s success.” —James Cameron
GUS: Reed Birney gave me this advice as well.

CHRIS SACCA

Be your unapologetically weird self.

ARNOLD

Arnold makes films or stars in them, but he doesn’t invest in them. He’s offset the potential volatility of his own career by investing primarily in real estate.

DEREK SIVERS

Choose the plan with the most options. The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.”

When you’re earlier in your career, I think the best strategy is to just say ‘yes’ to everything. Every little gig. You just never know what are the lottery tickets.

The standard pace is for chumps.

I believe you shouldn’t start a business unless people are asking you to.

TONY ROBBINS

Life is always happening for us, not to us. It’s our job to find out where the benefit is. If we do, life is magnificent.
GUS: Again, see Mark Manson: “What if it was a gift?”

Buffet: “Investing in yourself is the most important investment you’ll ever make in your life.”

State → Story → Strategy

TIM FERRISS: Morning pages are, as author Julia Cameron puts it, “spiritual windshield wipers.”

SETH GODIN

A) You should taste the food as you go, which a surprisingly small number of people do; and B) salt and olive oil actually are cheating and they’re secret weapons and they always work.

Creativity is an infinite resource. The more you spend,the more you have.

KEVIN KELLY - 1000 True Fans

To be a successful creator, you don’t need millions. You don’t need millions of dollars or millions of customers, clients, or fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only 1,000 true fans.

True fan = a fan who will buy anything you produce.

You do not have to sacrifice the integrity of your art for a respectable income. You just need to create a great experience and charge enough.

Don’t Try and Find Time. Schedule Time.

BJ NOVAK

I consider being in a good mood the most important part of my creative process.

BJ MILLER

When you are struggling with just about anything, look up. Just ponder the night sky for a minute and realize that we’re all on the same planet at the same time. As far as we can tell, we’re the only planet with life like ours on it anywhere nearby. Then you start looking at the stars, and you realize that the light hitting your eye is ancient, [some of the] stars that you’re seeing, they no longer exist by the time that the light gets to you. Just mulling the bare-naked facts of the cosmos is enough to thrill me, awe me, freak me out, and kind of put all my neurotic anxieties in their proper place. A lot of people—when you’re standing at the edge of your horizon, at death’s door, you can be much more in tune with the cosmos.

I’ve gotten a lot of miles out of a beautiful bottle of wine, not just for the taste and the buzz, but the symbolism of delighting in something that goes away.

For hospice patients at death’s door, big existential conversations aren’t always the needed medicine. One oddly powerful alternative is baking cookies together. “You’re rewarded for being alive and in the moment. Smelling a cookie is not on behalf of some future state. It’s great in the moment, by itself, on behalf of nothing. And this is another thing back to art. Art for its own sake. Art and music and dance. Part of its poignancy is its purposelessness, and just delighting in a wacky fact of perhaps a meaningless universe and how remarkable that is. One way for all of us to live until we’re actually dead is to prize those little moments.”
(Relevant to theatre)

Discipline = Freedom

I think that in order to truly experience the light and the bright, you have to see the darkness. I think if you shield yourself from the darkness, you’ll not appreciate—and fully understand—the beauty of life.

SAM HARRIS

You should take LSD.

KEVIN KELLY

‘Productive’ is for your middle ages. When you’re young, you want to be prolific and make and do things, but you don’t want to measure them in terms of productivity. You want to measure them in terms of extreme performance, you want to measure them in extreme satisfaction.

WHITNEY CUMMINGS

In order for art to imitate life, you have to have a life.

CAL FUSSMAN

On interviewing: aim for the heart, not the head. Once you get the heart, you can go to the head. Once you get the heart and the head, then you’ll have a pathway to the soul.

Listening is about being present, not just being quiet.

The good shit sticks.

**NAVAL RAVIKANT**

Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.

Total honesty at all times. It’s almost always possible to be honest and positive.

Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett).

“Free education is abundant, all over the Internet. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce.”

My one repeated learning in life: ‘There are no adults.’ Everyone’s making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.

A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.

If you don’t believe in an afterlife, then you [should realize] that this is such a short and precious life, it is really important that you don’t spend it being unhappy. There is no excuse for spending most of your life in misery. You’ve only got 70 years out of the 50 billion or however long the universe is going to be around.

Write in a trance and act in a trance. You don’t want to think consciously about it.
