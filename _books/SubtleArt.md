  After a re-read I've come to appreciate this book a lot. Really internalizing Manson’s five values — Responsibility, Uncertainty, Failure, Rejection, Death — has been transformative. Taking responsibility for everything in your life is one of the most important things you can do. Realize that you’re wrong about everything probably and move towards uncertainty. DO SOMETHING and be ready to fail. Be able to say no and take no, because that rejection is essential. And take the bitter antidote — that death is certain. Life will always have problems. So it’s about working with these problems that you enjoy, and accepting them.

  The book is a bit scattered. It has some paragraphs that conflict with each other. But I totally respect Manson and love his ideas, so I accept those problems. (See what I did there?)

Fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be.

The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.

By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell.

The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

“You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” - Camus

Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others.

Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience.

Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.

Suffering is inevitable. Things don’t always work out the way you want. Stop being entitled.

You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.

If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about.

We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful.

Like our physical pain, our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable. In some cases, experiencing emotional or psychological pain can be healthy or necessary.

To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action.

True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.

Negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something.

We should make a habit of questioning our emotions.

Ask yourself: “what pain do you want in your life?” Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.

This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes.

A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character frankly and then acts to improve upon them.

The realization that you and your problems are not privileged in their severity or pain is the first and most important step toward solving them.

Once you accept the premise that a life is worthwhile only if it is truly notable and great, then you basically accept the fact that most of the human population (including yourself) sucks and is worthless. And this mindset can quickly turn dangerous, to both yourself and others.

People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great and they could be so much better.

By accepting your mundane existence you will have a growing appreciation for life’s basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about. These things are ordinary for a reason: they are what actually matters.

Values underlie everything we are and do.

Honest self-questioning is difficult. The more uncomfortable the answer, the more likely it is to be true.

If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.

Some values and metrics are better than others. Some lead to good problems that are easily and regularly solved. Others lead to bad problems that are not easily and regularly solved.

Pleasure is a bad value. People who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose. It is not the cause of happiness, it is the effect.

When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life’s problems. And when we deny our problems, we rob ourselves of the chance to solve them and generate happiness. Problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life.

Good values: 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable.
Bad values: 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable.

Examples of good values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.

FIVE VALUES: RESPONSIBILITY, UNCERTAINTY, FAILURE, REJECTION, DEATH

### RESPONSIBILITY: You are always choosing

There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerges. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances.

When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered.

We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond.

Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences. It’s impossible not to be.

The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives. Accepting responsibility for our problems is thus the first step to solving them.

Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense.

Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you. Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you.

If the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it.

You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. It really is that simple. It’s just not easy.


### UNCERTAINTY: You’re wrong about everythiing

Growth is an endlessly iterative process. I’m always wrong about everything, over and over and over again, and that’s why my life improves.

We shouldn’t seek to find the ultimate “right” answer for ourselves, but rather, we should seek to chip away at the ways that we’re wrong today so that we can be a little less wrong tomorrow.

Many people become so obsessed with being “right” about their life that they never end up actually living it.

Our values are our hypotheses: this behavior is good and important; that other behavior is not. Our actions are the experiments; the resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data.


Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves.

Our memories work like the telephone game. They are horribly unreliable.

The problem here is that not only is certainty unattainable, but the pursuit of certainty often breeds more (and worse) insecurity. See: sneaking peek at boyfriend’s text message.

The more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.

The more we admit we do not know, the more opportunities we gain to learn.

When we let go of the stories we tell about ourselves, to ourselves, we free ourselves up to actually act (and fail) and grow.

My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.

HOW TO BE A LITTLE LESS CERTAIN OF YOURSELf

Question yourself:

1. What if I’m wrong?

We’re all the world’s worst observers of ourselves.

“Am I jealous—and if I am, then why?” “Am I angry?” “Is she right, and I’m just protecting my ego?” Questions like these need to become a mental habit.

2. What would it mean if I were wrong?

“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” - Aristotle

Being able to look at and evaluate different values without necessarily adopting them is perhaps the central skill required in changing one’s own life in a meaningful way.

Probing questions are necessary in order to get at the core problems that are motivating our dickish behavior.

3. Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?

If it’s down to me being screwed up, or everybody else being screwed up, it is far, far, far more likely that I’m the one who’s screwed up.

### FAILURE: Failure is the way forward

Failure itself is a relative concept.

Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you’ve failed at something.

If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed.

For many of us, our proudest achievements come in the face of the greatest adversity. Our pain often makes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded.

Dabrowski: fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth. And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential.

VCR questions: just shut up and do it.

Life is about not knowing and then doing something anyway. All of life is like this. It never changes. Even when you’re happy.

Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.

Action → Inspiration → Motivation

If we follow the “do something” principle, failure feels unimportant.

With simply doing something as your only metric for success—well, then even failure pushes you forward.

### REJECTION: The importance of saying no

Freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning, but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningful about it. Ultimately, the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one’s life is through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or (gulp) one person.

Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves.

We need to reject something. Otherwise, we stand for nothing.

To truly appreciate something, you must confine yourself to it. There’s a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you’ve spent decades investing in a single relationship, a single craft, a single career. And you cannot achieve those decades of investment without rejecting the alternatives.

BOUNDARIES:

Romantic love is kind of like cocaine. Like, frighteningly similar to cocaine. Like, stimulates the exact same parts of your brain as cocaine. Like, gets you high and makes you feel good for a while but also creates as many problems as it solves, as does cocaine.

There are healthy forms of love and unhealthy forms of love. Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.

The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner.

People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems.

A healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other.

You both should support each other. But only because you choose to support and be supported. Not because you feel obligated or entitled.

Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.

Ask yourself, “If I refused, how would the relationship change?” Similarly, ask, “If my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?” If the answer is that a refusal would cause a blowout of drama and broken china plates, then that’s a bad sign for your relationship.

BUILDING TRUST:

Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason that without trust, the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything.

Honesty in my relationship is more important to me than feeling good all the time. The last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the woman I love.

When our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good, or to always make our partner feel good, then nobody ends up feeling good.

Both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no.

Conflict is not only normal, then; it’s absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a healthy relationship.

When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Without the first step, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place.

FREEDOM THROUGH COMMITMENT:

Pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience.

Yes, breadth of experience is likely necessary and desirable when you’re young—after all, you have to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in. But depth is where the gold is buried.

### DEATH: And then you die

If there really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to not do anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all just a bunch of nothing anyway.

Death is the light by which the shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.

Once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.

Meditation can prepare oneself for death while still remaining alive, by dissolving one’s ego into an expansive nothingness.

“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” - Mark Twain

Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial. Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty. And as such, it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions.

The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself. This is the basic root of all happiness: caring about something greater than yourself, believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity, that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production.

As alluring as it is, entitlement isolates us. Our curiosity and excitement for the world turns in upon itself and reflects our own biases and projections onto every person we meet and every event we experience. This feels sexy and enticing and may feel good for a while and sells a lot of tickets, but it’s spiritual poison.

You are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain death, you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to. This mere fact, this simple optioning for your own values in life, already makes you beautiful, already makes you successful, and already makes you loved.

You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived.

“We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should make us love each other, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and flattened by life’s trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.” - Charles Bukowski

There is nothing to be afraid of. Ever. And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind.

The more I peer into the darkness, the brighter life gets, the quieter the world becomes, and the less unconscious resistance I feel to, well, anything.
