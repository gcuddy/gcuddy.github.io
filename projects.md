# Projects
{: .f2 .lh-title}

# [Book Notes](/book)
{: .f4}

I collect my notes from the books I've read and put them here.

# [Photography](/photo)
{: .f4}

I have always loved photography and cinema. Lately I've been getting back into it as a side hobby, just snapping things on my phone as they come up and editing them later.

# Untitled theatre company
{: .f4}

A new thing that aims to lower the barrier-of-entry to create and see theatre. Very early stages.

# [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/thelobster/)
{: .f4}

I try to track the films I've seen here and write about them. It's sporadic and my thoughts are very much not fully fleshed out, but it's there if you're interested.

# [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:guscuddy/public/)
{: .f4}

I share interesting links I've found from the internet on my public [pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in) page. Check it out!

# [Ian with Flowers](http://ianwithflowers.tumblr.com)
{: .f4}

Just trying to make the world a better place.
