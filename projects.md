# [Book Notes](/book)
{: .f4}

I collect my notes from the books I've read and put them here.

# [Photography](/photo)

I have always loved photography and cinema. Lately I've been getting back into it as a side hobby, just snapping things on my phone as they come up and editing them later.

# Untitled theatre company

A new thing that aims to lower the barrier-of-entry to create and see theatre. Very early stages.

That's this website. Powered by Jekyll and Github Pages.

Just trying to make the world a better place.
