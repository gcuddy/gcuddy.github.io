As I write this I’m in Oslo, Norway.

I’m here because I missed my connecting flight in Stockholm to JFK. The next flight on Norwegian Air wasn't till the next evening in Oslo, so they flew me there and gave me a free hotel and food.

When I missed the flight, I was disappointed for a minute or two, but then I quickly realized that this would just be another adventure. I immediately met a very nice lady from Kazakhstan. We flew to Oslo, and met two great people who live in Norway but also missed a flight and were staying at the hotel with us. We all got dinner together and talked for hours. It was really fun.

The point is, this was completely unexpected.

And, continually, the unexpected route is always the most fun.

A week and a half ago, I helped a friend who I had just met move some avocados into the basement of a Mexican nightclub in Milan on Cinco de Mayo. Next thing I knew my friend and I were tasked with making guacamole in the kitchen for 600 people. This was totally unexpected, and totally fun. The guacamole turned out great and I made lots of new friends.

Why do we fear the unexpected? Perhaps because we are caught up in what [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) calls the ‘experiencing self’ as opposed to considering our ‘remembering self’. In the initial experience, the unexpected can seem daunting and terrible, and we may reject it. I did not want to miss my flight. The idea of getting stuck making guacamole for hours did not sound enticing. And yet, both of these ended up being great. Why?

Because the remembering self — the thing that turns these experiences into memories, into stories — has a great time with them. All of a sudden, the missed flight becomes a crazy adventure and full of serendipitous meetings. The guacamole event becomes an all-time classic Cinco de Mayo.

This, of course, is not universally applicable: sometimes there are things that are unexpected and bad. But I find that more often than not embracing the unexpected route results in more great adventures and stories.

Life becomes a lot more fun that way.
