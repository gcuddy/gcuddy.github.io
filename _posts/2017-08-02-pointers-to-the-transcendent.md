If you read the news regularly, you might think the world is shit.

And let me be clear: it's true that there are shit things in the world. But when we're bombarded daily with horrifying headlines and images, we can confuse the [finger for the moon](http://guscuddy.com/moon).

Instead, let's look for pointers to the transcendent. We need them now more than ever.

Humans used to consciously build pointers to the transcendent. Pyramids, churches, monuments, paintings, sculptures, symbols. But their meaning has become confused over the years. Derren Brown, in his book [_Happy_](http://guscuddy.com/book/Happy), writes:

> The perpetuating dogmas, rituals and images, once so richly symbolic and important, are of course mocked by dis-believers and shown to have no meaning in themselves. As if they were ever supposed to be anything other than pointers to the transcendent. Yet in the meantime these symbols have become forms of idolatry, mistaken by the religious for the _destination_, when they were only intended as _signposts_.

It's easy to be a nihilist. But what are the pointers to the transcendent around us every day? Not in a religious sense, but in a _meaning_ sense?

Is it the way sunlight fills your room when you open the curtains in the morning? The joyful tap dancer on the subway? The towering ceilings of Grand Central Station? The ecstasy of experiencing great art? The feeling of water on your skin in summertime? The adrenaline of jumping off a ledge into the blue watering hole below? The freckles on a lover's arm?

When things seem to be perpetually shit, it can help to change the story we tell ourselves. We can do this by opening to these [tiny beautiful things](http://therumpus.net/2011/02/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-64/). Instead of looking for the darkness, where is the light coming in?

Amidst all this, we must remember that _the things themselves are not transcendent_. They are not the _destination_. They merely point to it.

But if we open our eyes and live with intention, they're all around us. Every day. Little pointers to the transcendent, meant to deliver us from evil.
