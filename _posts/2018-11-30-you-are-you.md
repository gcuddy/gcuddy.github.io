You are you...

And only you can make things that you can make.

Great art comes through you. You are what we want to see.

I'm confident this is true across every form and every discipline. It's certainly true of acting, writing, and directing.

We want to see the world filtered through you. There is no magical code or formula to making things. It has to come from deep inside you, lay bare all the messed-up stuff that is buried under the surface.

Only you can make the art you can make.

That's what makes it unique.
