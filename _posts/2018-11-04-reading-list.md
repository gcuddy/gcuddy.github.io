title: "My reading list"
---

I've put together a list of some of my favorite (mostly non-fiction) books, books that have meant a great deal to me or that I have learned from. It's a work in progress. I'd like to keep updating this list as my own personal Reading List -- as [Ryan Holiday puts it, "Books to Base Your Life On"](https://ryanholiday.net/reading-list/). Note that I enjoy all these books, but I don't agree with everything inside them always.
