This is my annual post where I review the year. It's an effort to be transparent and vulnerable.

2017, as seems to be customary now, was a bit of a shitty year for the world. Things look not so great.

Personally speaking, 2017 was amazing. I continued to learn and grow, and have faith 2018 will be even better. Optimism has become central to my worldview, and thus I have to continue to believe my best growth is in front of me, and that extends to the world. If there isn't this deep, core optimism -- then why continue? I'm not an idiot idealist: I recognize the problems in the world and in our country and have deep fears about the future on a global scale. But I have to believe it's possible to save us. And on a personal level, I have to believe that I will grow tenfold next year and so on, so that when I look back on where I was right now a year from now I'm a bit embarrassed (as I am with almost every previous year rendition of me, when looking back).

## Acting

I re-made acting my priority this year. It worked out. I met amazing people, had incredible mentors, and took great classes. I have a manager and in January leave to do a four month regional theatre gig of *The Diary of Anne Frank*. It's an Equity contract, so I now can actually call myself an Actor.

I would like to continue to grow here, and am setting my goals higher for 2018.

## Living

I live in Brooklyn now. I love living in New York, more so than I have ever loved it before. It's a weird place. And it's great.

## Friends

I made friends a priority this year. I spent months in the first half of the year without a permanent home and staying with friends. I was in Italy with my friend Ian for a while. I love all these people deeply. I made many new friends and these came back into my life with unexpectedly great ripples. The second half of the year, I really made making new friends a priority. I have met so many incredible people this year, been surrounded by so much love and positivity, and that gives me so much joy.

If I have positive relationships and am doing work I'm excited about, I'm happy. It's as simple as that.

## Producing, Writing, Directing

I assistant directed a show the first couple months of the year. That was fun and an amazing learning experience.

I started a crazy thing where my friend Lawrence and I are going to produce a musical written my new friend Steph. I'm really, really excited about this, but don't want to talk too much about it here. I'm hopeful it will turn into something really great in 2018.

I've done a good amount of writing, though I have kept most of it to myself. In 2018, I want to make an effort to share and act on more of it. This blog (and my [Medium profile](http://medium.com/@guscuddy)) are a start. I'm also working on finishing a play and a web series.

## My Favorite Things in 2017

### Theatre

I didn't see much theatre that blew me away this year. Here were my favorite shows:

* Derren Brown's SECRET
* INDECENT
* 1984
* MASTER
* THE BAND'S VISIT
* Robert LePage's 887

I missed several well-received shows, unfortunately. Life goes on.

### Movies

It was a great year for movies. I still have a lot to catch up on, but my favorites right now:

1. A Ghost Story
2. Good Time
3. Get Out
4. Lady Bird
5. Phantom Thread
6. Meyerowitz Stories

I was really disappointed with THE LAST JEDI and THE DISASTER ARTIST.

### TV

One of my favorite TV shows ever concluded this year: I think *The Leftovers* is one of the great works of art of the 21st century. It's third season was magnificent and overwhelming and maybe the thing that captured the psyche of America in 2017 more than anything else. I also liked individual episodes of *Master of None* and *Bojack Horseman* a lot, though as seasons both had pretty significant flaws, I thought. There's too much TV and I want to catch up on a lot of it.

### Books

WHEN YOU READ THIS, I THINK I WILL HAVE FINISHED *INFINITE JEST*. I AM FREED.

I also read a lot of other books. One that had a big impact on me was Derren Brown's *Happy*.

### Music

This was the year I finally got over whiny male indie rock (mostly). That's pretty much enough said.

* SZA - Ctrl
* Adult Mom - Soft Spots
* Lorde - Melodrama
* Kendrick Lamar - DAMN.
* Young Thug - Beautiful Thugger Girls
* Mount Eerie - A Crow Looked at Me
* Vince Staples - Big Fish Theory
* Run the Jewels 3
* King Krule - Ooz
* Migos - Culture
* Jlin - Black Origami
* Perfume Genius - No Shape
* Kelela - Take Me Apart
* Lil B - Black Ken
* Lana del Rey - Lust for Life
* Slowdive - Slowdive
* Jay Som - Everybody Works
* Sampha - Process
* Moses Sumney - Aromanticism
* Jay-Z - 4:44
* Tyler, the Creator - Flower Boy
* Fever Ray - Plunge

### Podcasts

Podcasts continued to grow as an art form this year. My favorites:

* S-Town (a flawed masterpiece, but an incredible achievement for the form)
* Heavyweight
* This American Life
* Revisionist History
* Conversations with Tyler
* Still Processing
* The Nod
* Uncivil
* WTF
* The Bill Simmons Podcast
* Reply All
* The Daily

For comedy: Comedy Bang Bang, U Talking U 2 To Me (somehow did 2 episodes this year), and I finally listened to the masterpiece that is Analyze Phish.
