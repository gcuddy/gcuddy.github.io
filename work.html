    I love acting and theatre. I also love many other things. Here is a collection of my work.

    <h1 class="f3">Playwriting</h3>
    <p class="dark-gray lh-copy baskerville">I'm currently writing two plays. The first is a 90-minute comedy/drama about growing up, death, and the limitations of time. It's called <a href="" class="bg-light-green b black link dim">All My Friends</a>. The second is a larger two-act play about startups, VR porn, cheating death, and ambition. It's called <a href="" class="bg-light-green b black link dim">Livin' Thing</a>.</p>

    <h1 class="f3">Untitled Theatre Company</h3>
    <p class="dark-gray lh-copy baskerville">I believe theatre is our most important storytelling form. I also believe it's business model is in dire shape. The barrier for young companies to produce work is far too high. It's been commodified by elites, made into a high-minded cultural night out. It needs to be knocked down a peg: going to the theatre should, on average, be more like going to a DIY punk show than going to the opera. That's what this company will aim to do.</p>
