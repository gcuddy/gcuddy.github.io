The longing, brutal simplicity of framing.

Shadows against bare walls.

The deadness of performance - in a good way, from actor who plays Michel.

The hidden nature of suits.

I love how Michel's is ill fitting. 

Patterns of content. Of walls and trains. 

The alarming nature of that child towards the end. 

Long takes but not too long.

Despairing.

The only poetry of content being the actual pickpocketing. 

It really is so touching when Michel brings the money to Jeanne. 

This quiet sense of unease. 

Perfect sound design during horse race scene. Simple, striking. Such clarity of storytelling. 

Such great tension as Michel tries to pickpocket the police man at the races. So perfect. Kind of heart stopping. And when he gets captured - ugh. 

I love how we see Michel through bars. Jeanne not.

Bresson's skills at composition are just astounding. Such simplicity and clarity. 

This existentialist bent that doesn't quite reach Mouchette or Balthasar in despair.  But reminds me of The Stranger. 

Ending is surprisingly hopeful, actually so beautiful. 

I love what Bresson does: actors do not emote. He calls them “models”. We are given a man and a situation: what are we to make of it? I would like All My Friends to take on some of that quality. The idea of just showing the situation with utmost clarity, simplicity, and bleak composition. But we are not inciting the audience to feel something — it’s a sort of question.
Bresson is very Dostoevskian. Christian, huge existential despair running through. Similarly philsoophical, in that we get to choose what to make of the thing. What are we to make of that ending? What are we to make of Michel behind bars? The film doesn’t explicitly tell us.
I do not come from the same philosophical Christian perspective of Bresson (obviously) but I really do like the way he presents these situations. Is there a way to work that into AMF?
Also, shadows.
