<div id="intro" class="lh-title dib f1-ns f2-m f2">Recommended Links</div>

I’d like to use the internet to help spread ideas about theatre, and help it thrive in the 21st century.

I've been collecting these links for years: videos, articles, essays, etc. These are my favorites.

This list will be updated whenever I come across something new and exciting.

**And if you like these ideas, you’ll love my weekly newsletter, The Curtain. [Subscribe here.](https://guscuddy.substack.com/)**

**[Sara Holdren on criticism and directing](https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/i-make-plays-i-write-criticism-im-not-my-own-enemy.html)**

Sara Holdren has been one of the most influential writers for me over the last two years. In this piece, she discusses why being both a critic and a theatre-maker is not only possible, but preferable. She sets out why more theatre practitioners should write about theatre, which I fully believe as well, and is why I started writing.

**[Simon Stone and Anne Bogart talk YERMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qficpne0ITo)**

A great discussion from when Stone mounted YERMA at the Park Ave Armory. They talk extensively about Stone’s process, being an artist, storytelling, design, and philosophies. I learned a lot from this. From Simon Stone, I also like this [discussion of his set design](https://www.surfacemag.com/articles/simon-stone-talks-yerma-set-design/), [designing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wzR-PTlGw) and [rehearsing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNoh8Cpa3bM) YERMA, [an interview on bringing MEDEA to London](https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/interviews/2019/yerma-director-simon-stone-on-bringing-his-radical-medea-to-london-i-dont-make-directors-theatre-thats-a-misjudged-analysis/), and his [very simple TED Talk from 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6VFfGvAVZI).

**[Jeremy O’Harris interview on wanting more critics](https://www.whatshouldwedo.com/blog/jeremy-o-harris/)**

Jeremy O’Harris, one of the great new voices in theatre, discusses wanting more critics, and deepening the discourse: “People keep thinking: They hire one black critic who will finally have a black voice on the matters of black theater in America. I promise you, if you have seven black critics sit down to see Fairview, Sugar in Our Wounds, and Pass Over, they’re all going to say a different one was the best one.“

**[The problem with white critics critiquing work by Artists of Color](https://www.larktheatre.org/blog/problem-white-critics-critiquing-work-artists-color/)**

If we want more diversity in theatre it needs to come from all areas, not just in the two-dimensional area of who we see on stage. This great piece from Donja R. Love helps explain that.

**[Katie Mitchell and Robert Icke in Conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaeAgWMYu8w)**

Two of the best directors in the world talk about Chekhov, actors, the trouble with comedies, and their process.

**[Why Greeks Matter: Rupert Goold, Ivo Van Hove and Deborah Warner in conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6kYz-wx2rg)**

A great conversation between three great directors about Greeks, and directing in general.

**[Robert Icke](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2017/07/cruel-be-kind-radicalism-robert-icke)**

One of my favorite directors, Robert Icke is a force in London, and a huge influence on my thinking. I did a Directing Workshop class he taught in 2018 that made a large impact on me. This Helen Lewis article is an excellent introduction to his work. [Her piece on his 2018 production of The Wild Duck is also superb](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/10/wild-duck-lie), presenting a vision of how to stage works by problematic dead white men. If you liked this, check out [this long interview where he talks about his monumental adaptation and production of *Oresteia*](http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/pvcrs/2015/icke).
I also like [this interview in Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/rob-icke-its-not-impossible-that-theatre-will-die-out), and [this one on ending boredom](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/robert-icke-on-getting-hate-mail-why-mary-stuart-is-like-the-brexit-vote-and-ending-boredom-in-a3723841.html).

**[Theatre Laid Bare](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/theatre-laid-bare)**

This 2015 New Yorker profile is an excellent overview of Ivo Van Hove, before he had his huge streak of a Broadway success. It especially goes into detail about his controversial production of *Angels in America*. I learned a lot from this article, when I was first getting into Ivo’s work.

**[High Tide of Heartbreak](https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/09/27/high-tide-of-heartbreak/)**

A brilliant speech from Quiara Alegría Hudes on the “atheist white male aesthetics” that permeate theatre, and it’s huge exclusivity problems.

**[Against the New Play](https://howlround.com/against-new-play)**

In this brilliant piece in Howlround, the author stakes out a position against the generic “new play”, one that takes up space from more vital, more theatrical work. It’s a great piece that will make you think critically about the type of theatre we want to be producing.

**[Theater Review: The Good Intentions of American Son by Sara Holdren](https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/theater-review-the-good-intentions-of-american-son.html)**

My favorite Sara Holdren review, which eviscerates the righeous American "issue play", and dials into the role of theatre.

**[New York Times on The Yard](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/theater/yard-theater-london-now-festival.html)**

An interesting article on what could be a model for DIY theaters: being a nightclub as well.

**[The Count](https://www.dramatistsguild.com/advocacy/the-count-2/)**

The Dramatists Guild’s “The Count” details what is getting produced in America. The results aren’t exactly inspiring.

**[Isaac Butler on Sam Gold’s Othello](https://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2017/01/a-few-quick-bloggy-thoughts-on-the-sam-gold-daniel-craig-david-oyelowo-othello.html)**

There’s so many wonderful places to start with the great Isaac Butler, but I actually love this short blog post he wrote on this *Othello* and why it was so successful, by avoiding literal conceptualization. If you liked this, definitely check out his podcast *[Lend Me Your Ears](http://www.slate.com/articles/slate_plus/shakespeare.html)*.

**[Holger Syme on Robert Icke’s HAMLET](http://www.dispositio.net/archives/2385)**

An excellent essay on a stunning HAMLET filled to the brim with new ideas.

**[The Body in the Voice](https://www.americantheatre.org/2010/01/01/the-body-in-the-voice/)**

The late, great voice teacher Cicely Berry talks about her approach to Shakespeare. Lots to learn from here.

**[Kenneth Tynan’s List of Plays](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/sites/default/files/kenneth-tynan_list-of-plays.pdf)**

One of the great theatre critics and general essayists of the 20th century, Tynan also served as the Literary Manager for the National Theatre. He made a mammoth list of plays that should in be their repertoire. It’s available for free as a PDF, and is an exhaustive (mainly pre-1950s) theatre history list.
