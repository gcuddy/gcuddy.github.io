<h1 class="f4">My philosophy of theatre and art</h1>

As an [actor](/resume) and theatre artist I have worked with amazing people and institutions, and learned so much from all of them. I believe that the wonderful people you meet along the way are a major part of what makes this worth doing.

I love bringing myself fully to a project, sinking my teeth into something complex, collaborating with others, going from zero to one, and creating something new and exciting. I believe in vulnerability, truth and authenticity. I believe theatre should always be exciting, never boring or deadly.

I'm always thinking about what the role of theatre is in the 21st century, what we can do to ensure its survival and, more than that, its democratization.

Finally, as an artist I believe in not being locked into any particular genre or form, that each form is a form unto itself, and that you should have free rein to make art in whatever form is most appropriate to an idea.

<!-- Questions like:

* How do we democratize theatre, improving accessibility and diversity?
* How do we make a truly great, exciting, electric live experience?
* How can theatre use the internet?
* How does theatre interact and define itself in relation to other narrative (and non-narrative) mediums?
* What are the nature of stories? Is theatre simply storytelling, or something else entirely? -->
