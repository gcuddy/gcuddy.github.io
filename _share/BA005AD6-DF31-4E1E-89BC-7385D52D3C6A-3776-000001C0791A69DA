# Claire Barron masterclass notes

If you’re feeling stuck, just work for 45-90 minutes. Just take a baby chunk. Don’t need to work for 8 hours

Barron: all best writing is writing when she feels really good. Her least favorite parts of DANCE NATION are parts that were rewritten. Favorites were written once

Make writing feel good, enjoy it. Follow inspiration, etc.

Write plays in sharpie, write on floor, crazy paper. Work like an artist.

MAC WELLMAN/ JEAN LEE PRINCIPLES TO WRITE A PLAY:

1. MAKE IT BAD. DO NOT try to write a good scene.
	1. Kiss of death is trying to be good. Being bad can unlock a Miracles.
2. Make it boring. 
	1. This then became Barron’s first play
3. Make it stupid.

When group scenes: never write character headings. Just stream of consciousness of voices, then after figure out who is talking.

Image inspiration - use it to just go ahead and write write write
Give weird scenarios. The scenarios Barron gave us:

1. What I want someone to do to my body
2. Write a really boring party scene based off images
	1. Dog and cat
	2. Someone shows up
	3. A voice emerges and tells someone what they want them to do to their body

## Q AND A

### How to rewrite

Barron hated it, but Maria Striar taught her. It can be creative. B printed out all scenes, moved it around. Make it structural and fun.

Rewriting two pages forty times is not fun..

When B gives birth to play, it comes out whole. 

First draft is often best draft.

B’s first draft is often around 50 pages. Little shrunken head. Then gets it out.

Then play might be 100 pages.

You do not need to take notes from aanyone you don’t want to. YOU CHOOSE what notes to get.

Don’t let your play die from notes.

### Different experiences

If B is honest, every character in play is her.

Then actors bring their own lived experience to roles.

You write plays the way you write plays.

### Inspiration

**All Claire’s plays are inspired by trauma**

“Write today what you need to say if you’re going to die tomorrow.” - Deb Margolin

Steal from everything in life.

### Story Structure

Don’t believe in objectives and obstacles. 

We don’t have objectives as people. 

Auditory playwright - behavior and the way people talk. “Why did that person eat that cookie that way?”

Mac WELLMAN: go out in world and eavesdrop on conversation, with pen and paper. What you choose to write down and what you edit out, THAT’S your voice.

Don’t work with plot. DANCE NATION - it’s a competition. (That’s it)

### How do you know when to start a play

Tapping into something that’s really painful.

Write plays that are risky for your to write. It should make you uncomfortable and scared.

***

### Writing on your own vs formal program

Claire Barron haasn’t written a play in 4 years. (Wrote Chekhov adaptation this year tho)
Brooklyn College - where she mostly wrote her plays. 2 were trash, 2 were good.
Youngblood - 1 play a year (made her a playwright)
Getting in a formal writing group is great. If you don’t get in, create a writing group.

### Starting out as actor?

Write parts you would want to play.

Think bodily. Things you would get off on as an actor.

### Collaborators 

Right collaborators is most important thing, but you don’t know until you’re making the thing.

Claire looks for:

1. Actors that are specific with language
2. Weird actors
3. **Actors that feel pagan and ancient**
4. Directors with strong visual sense, and who are comfortable with strong playwright 

(Strengths that C doesn’t have)

**Communication**

### How to reconcile writing about trauma with liking to write

Good writing is like getting fucked

Emotional release, feels therapeutic. Like popping a pimple.

Good writing makes CB cry

“It’s not happy good, it’s pus good”

The superpower of being a writer is that when someone hurts you, you can do something with it.

### Where/how do you find endings of plays

Jenny Schwartz:
Soho Rep exercise:
1. write a boring scene.
2. write the ending of the play.

With DN, wrote ending first then changed ending years later.

CB loves Gestural endings (seeing actual 13 year old girl on stage, Dance, etc.)
