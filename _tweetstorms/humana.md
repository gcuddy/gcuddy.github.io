Here's a list of my takeaways from Humana Festival 2019 @ATLouisville - my first time there - and all the things I've learned about theatre in the past few months:

Creating new theatre is a hard and (mostly) iterative process. It's loopy and weird and collaborative and there is no magical formula.

A building with five shows rehearsing at the same time has palpable energy.

Doing deep work in a closed, productive rehearsal room (trying to invite serendipitous wonder), and then coming out and meeting other people who are coming out of their own rehearsals, to share lunch or a conversation, is a wonderful feeling.

Seeing inspiring work from your new friends is one of the best feelings in the world.

Continually, shows that lean into their unique theatricality are the most successful productions. With each year that passes, each new media form that emerges, this only becomes more and more true.

Plays and productions that lean into sculpting energy in a three-dimensional space -- considering the dimensions, shadows, nooks and crannies of the actual space -- are the most exciting.

Plays that deal with time, in some form, can be immensely moving.

Theatre is our most potent exploder of time. These productions are beautiful and explosive and can explore the invisible, the all-at-once. They reach for the transcendent. And then they disappear into nothingness, like all time does, like everything does.

(Differentiating them from any digital form.)

If possible, playwrights should be in the room when a new play is being rehearsed.

But despite it being a new play, there should be no writer -> director -> actor fascist hierarchy. There is a balance to be made.

Give actors ownership and agency over the text and the production, not reverence.

Boredom is the most deadly thing in theatre, and the greatest threat to the future of the form.

Artists should be paid enough to make their work and live comfortably, as stress-free as possible. It takes great unconscious energy to make great art, and when you are constantly worrying about money and surviving it is very hard to unleash that energy.

Everyone should spend some time out of NYC.

There are so many great young writers in theatre, and we need to do everything in our power to encourage and help them. The future of theatre, in this sense, is bright.

Acting is a physical feat. Theatre should embrace this. This doesn't mean running around in circles for no reason -- it can mean constraints: an actor literally sitting in a chair for 90 minutes straight. But there must be some of acknowledgment of the physical.

Stage moving pictures are way better than stage pictures. What are the visceral aesthetics? How does it feel in motion?

Telling stories of underrepresented people is, obviously, extremely important. Yet we still don't do it enough. And even more than that: we still don't engage underrepresented audiences nearly enough. People must see themselves on stage.

Having a great dramaturg is one of the single most important things for a new play. A great dramaturg makes everyone involved -- actors, directors, designers, stage manager -- 100x more confident in what they're doing.

[The Peak-End theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule) applies to theatre: we remember the peak, and the ending. It's worth thinking about. When I think about the best theatre I've seen throughout my life, I think almost always of the 1-3 peaks in the show, and the ending.

Imposter syndrome is a part of being an artist. As is feeling inadequate. As is the feeling of emptiness after a production. As is the feeling that when you have no job lined up, you will never work again.

The possibilities in theatre are endless when it is treated as a medium of metaphor, and you move away from the literal.

Theatre that accesses the unconscious wells inside us is always the best theatre. It can move us in unconscious ways we cannot explain. It's also often the theatre that is [most misunderstood](https://twitter.com/chris_shinn/status/1116482341105483778).

The best parts of being an actor are having fun and the time you spend with amazing people.
