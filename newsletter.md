# The Newsletter

I often get asked by friends to recommend some theatre or books. (Or, lately, even podcasts.)

I see a lot of theatre (usually in NYC), read a lot, listen to quite a few podcasts, and watch a good amount of movies.

So I put together a private email list. It's intended for theatremakers, artists, friends, and other curious people. Somewhere around once a month I send out a list of 7-10 interesting things. Usually some things I've been reading or theatre I've seen, and maybe some film, podcasts, or TV.  It's sort of like [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/) or [Ryan Holiday's](https://ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/) newsletters, but with more of a focus on theatre and art. (Btw, you should be subscribed to their newsletters, if you aren't already.)  

It's short and simple. Why not sign up?

The emails are sent from my personal email and you can reply directly, or unsubscribe anytime.
