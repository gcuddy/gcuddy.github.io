## Quotes

“Chatter with the angels in the morning / chatter with the angels all day long”
-Children’s bible song

“[After sadness passes] one might easily suppose that nothing had happened, but we have altered the way a house alters when a guest enters it. We cannot say who has come, perhaps we will never know, but there are indications that it is the future that enters into us like this, in order to be transformed within us, long before it actually occurs.”
-Rilke

## Pictures

Very influenced by Garry Winogrand. These are all his pictures. Don't sue me.
