## Quotes

“give yourself a pat on the back or have some girl put your large kappa sigma dick down her throat”
-Evan Spiegel, Snapchat co-Founder & CEO

“I sat down to lunch with him [Paul Thomas Anderson] one day and I was like, ‘Dude, pick and choose your battles.’ And he looked me square in the eye and said, ‘Graziano, you never pick and choose your battles. If you feel passionately about something, you go after it, no matter how many things you’ve got on the table.’”
-Mark Graziano, Postproduction Supervisor on Boogie Nights [From Livin’ Thing: An Oral History of Boogie Nights on Grantland]

“Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing.”
-John Stuart Mill
