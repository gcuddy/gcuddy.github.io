# <a name="start"></a>Start Here

Hey!

Thanks for stopping by my home on the internet. My personal website acts as my resume, and a collection of my favorite things: theatre, art, learning, and culture. Take a look around.

## Me in 10 Seconds

I'm an [actor](/#acting), which is the thing I have spent the most time doing, and probably the thing I love most.

I'm also a [writer](/blog), and send out <a href="https://guscuddy.substack.com/" target="_blank">a weekly newsletter</a> about theatre and other things. I think you'll like it. <a href="https://guscuddy.substack.com/" target="_blank">Subscribe here</a>.

I'm getting into directing.

I take [extensive notes](/notes/#notes) on the books and media I consume. I love learning.

I grew up in Rochester, NY.

I was born in Davis, CA.

I currently reside in Brooklyn, NY.

I'm half middle-eastern. I'm of Armenian, Lebanese, Egyptian and Irish descent. But identity is complicated.
