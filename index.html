    Hey, I'm Gus. I'm 22. I like to create things.
    </p>

    <p class="dark-gray measure-wide lh-copy baskerville">
    Generally, I do theatre. Most recently, I assistant directed <a href="" class="b black link dim">The Lake Effect</a> at Geva Theatre Center in Rochester, NY. Check out my <a href="" class="bg-light-green link b black dim">theatre credits here</a>.

    <br><br>

    I <a href="http://medium.com/@guscuddy" class="bg-light-green b link black dim">write regularly</a> on theatre and life. I also have a <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/guscuddy" class="bg-light-green b black link dim">newsletter</a> I send out sporadically to my friends.

    <br><br>

    In addition, I write plays. Currently, I am working on my first full-length, called <a href="" class="b black link dim">All My Friends</a>.

    <br><br>

    I am also involved in many other projects. I like directing, coding, and learning. Check out my <a href="" class="link b black dim">projects</a> page for more.

    <br><br>

    I love meeting new people and making friends. Feel free to <a href="mailto:gus.cuddy@gmail.com" class="b black link dim">email me</a>. You can also find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/guscuddy" class="b black link dim">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com/guscuddy" class="b black link dim">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://medium.com/@guscuddy" class="link black b dim">Medium</a>.
