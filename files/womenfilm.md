- [x] Atlantics directed by Mati Diop
	* Intense motif of the Atlantic Ocean
	* Interesting mixture of genres and styles
	* Ultimately a ghost story, but also a love story, and a political story.
	* A bit hard to grasp around the edges, but the thrust of the film is totally original and leaves an impression.
